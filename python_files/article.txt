NAGPUR: Afghanistan stretched their T20I record against Scotland to 6-0 with a 14-run win facilitated by their explosive opener Mohammad Shahzad and a spin-heavy attack to defend 170.Scotland were well on course in the chase after their openers packed a powerful stand of 84 runs in under nine overs, but the Afghanistan spinners dismissed the openers and then strangled the middle order to throw the chase off track.Scotland needed 77 runs from the half-way mark with eight wickets in hand but the Afghanistan spinners lived up to their captain's decision of batting first to allow the slower bowlers to do their work later on.On what looked like a slower pitch after the opening match in Nagpur, the two teams were set for much stronger totals after the platforms laid by their top orders. But both innings were jolted in the middle overs and Afghanistan eventually prevailed to start their World T20 campaign with a win, to bury memories of their Asia Cup opening-match loss against UAE last month.Shahzad started in his usual aggressive fashion and overcame some improvised bowling from the Scotland pacers in the Powerplay to cut loose later on.Shahzad and Noor Ali Zadran provided a flying start by putting on 25 in under three overs before Noor Ali steered a short ball straight to third man.Shahzad followed that by targeting the leg-side and straight boundaries to race towards a 32-ball fifty, his ninth in T20Is.ï¿½",3/8/2016,Afghanistan defeat Scotland by 14 ru
