But both innings were jolted in the middle overs and Afghanistan eventually prevailed to start their World T20 campaign with a win, to bury memories of their Asia Cup opening-match loss against UAE last month.Shahzad started in his usual aggressive fashion and overcame some improvised bowling from the Scotland pacers in the Powerplay to cut loose later on.Shahzad and Noor Ali Zadran provided a flying start by putting on 25 in under three overs before Noor Ali steered a short ball straight to third man.Shahzad followed that by targeting the leg-side and straight boundaries to race towards a 32-ball fifty, his ninth in T20Is.�",3/8/2016,Afghanistan defeat Scotland by 14 ru,sports

Andrews, a Fox sportscaster who used to work for ESPN, had sought $75 million in damages.""We're disappointed with the outcome,"" defense attorney Marc Dedman told reporters. He said he would consult with his clients - the hotel owners and its former operators - on whether they would appeal.Jurors began deliberating on Monday morning after the two-week trial concluded on Friday.""I've been honored by all the support from victims around the world. Their outreach has helped me be able to stand up and hold accountable those whose job it is to protect everyone's safety, security and privacy,"" Andrews said in a brief statement on her Twitter feed.Andrews testified for two days during the trial, saying that since the video was seen by millions of people, she experienced serious mental injury, including depression, crying spells and sleeplessness.Her lawyers argued that the hotel was negligent and could have prevented the incident.The video was taken by Michael David Barrett, who pleaded guilty in 2009 to stalking Andrews and making the video. He was sentenced to 30 months in prison.Barrett asked the hotel to put him in a room next to Andrews' after an employee confirmed to him that she was staying there on a certain date. He rigged a peep hole to shoot the video of Andrews while she was changing.Lawyers for the hotel argued that the responsibility was solely Barrett's and there was no way the hotel could have foreseen what he did.The parties who were found liable were West End Hotel Partners, the investment group that owned the Nashville Marriott, and the operating company of the hotel at the time, Windsor Capital Group. Marriott International was originally named in Andrews' lawsuit, but the judge removed it.The jury found that the hotel is liable for 49 percent of the $55 million in damages, or $26.95 million, while Barrett is liable for 51 percent of the damages, equivalent to $28.05 million.",3/8/2016,Jury finds hotel liable in Erin Andrews stalker video ,sports

I let my fans down and I let the sport down,"" said Sharapova, a teenage tennis prodigy who became the third-youngest Wimbledon champion.

If a player bears no fault or negligence, there is no suspension.According to Forbes, she earned $29.5 million in 2015, mostly from endorsements.Sharapova said her family doctor had been giving her mildronate, which is also called meldonium, for 10 years after she frequently became sick, had irregular EKG results, a magnesium deficiency and a family history of diabetes.""It is very important for you to understand that for 10 years this medicine was not on WADA's banned list and I had been legally taking the medicine. But on January the first, the rules have changed and meldonium became a prohibited substance.""The World Anti-Doping Agency, or WADA, declined to comment until ITF issues a final decision.Meldonium is used to treat chest pain and heart attacks among other conditions, but some researchers have linked it to increased athletic performance and endurance. It is listed by WADA among its prohibited metabolic modulators, along with insulin, and some researchers say it can also help recovery.It is not approved in the United States but is available in Russia, Latvia and other countries in that region. Over the past month, Russian cyclist Eduard Vorganov, Russian figure skater Ekaterina Bobrova and Ethiopia-born athletes Endeshaw Negesse and Abeba Aregawi and Ukraine biathletes Olga Abramova and Artem Tyshchenko have all tested positive for meldonium.Sharapova is the most prominent tennis player to test positive for a banned substance in recent years.�",3/8/2016,Tennis star Sharapova faces suspension after failing drug ,sports

"CAPE TOWN: South Africa staged a sensational comeback in defence of a below-par total to claim a first T20 series win over West Indies and sound a warning ahead of the World T20.South Africa's victory came less than three weeks after they beat England for the first time in a T20 and illustrated the progress the team has made since September 2014, when they were beaten 4-0 by England.West Indies, who have not lost a series in the same period of time, will be disappointed with their failure to complete a straightforward chase, especially as they were well on course.They had reached 81 for 3 in the 15th over and even though their captain Stafanie Taylor had been bowled around her legs by Dane van Niekerk, they had their other stalwart Deandra Dottin on hand.Dottin seemed to be striking the ball better than any of her team-mates but when she attempted a loft over long-on, she mistimed to spark a collapse. South Africa took four more wickets in the next 18 balls and then squeezed at the end to pull off a remarkable win.South Africa recovered from an early blow when Shamilia Connell had Trisha Chetty caught at slip and rebuilt cautiously through van Niekerk was joined and Mignon du Preez.The pair found the boundary just five times but rotated strike well to score at more than a run-a-ball and put on 48 for the second wicket. When van Niekerk was bowled as she tried to slog sweep Taylor over midwicket, and with the run-rate stagnating, du Preez took it on herself to try and force the pace. She managed only to gift a catch to short midwicket.Marizanne Kapp and Lizelle Lee also found it heavy going but with South Africa yet to reach 100 and only two overs left, they took some risks. Lee was the only batsman to clear the boundary and her efforts at the end gave South Africa something to defend but when West Indies knocked off the first 14 runs inside two overs, they would not have expected to be successful.Moseline Daniels had Kycia Knight trapped lbw to provide some early hope but that only brought Taylor to the crease. She tried to end matters quickly with her aggressive approach and when she was bowled, Dottin took over. It was only when Dottin was caught that South Africa fought back.Kyshona Knight departed soon after Dottin, sharp fielding resulted in the run-outs of Shermaine Campbell and Shaquana Quintyne and Shabnim Ismail took a good catch off her own bowling to give South Africa belief. Daniels and Ismail bowled tightly at the end and South Africa's fielders were on high alert to deny West Indies.�",3/9/2016,South Africa women clinch thriller to take series 2 1,sports

Captain Peter Borren started off the assault with a one-handed sweep through midwicket for four. Subsequently, he was dropped in the same region by Nasir Hossain before the same fielder caught him at the end of the over.In the next over, Mortaza, who conceded one four in his spell, was unlucky not to have Cooper's wicket after the ball struck the off stump but the bails didn't budge.

"strong>MUMBAI: The World Twenty20 has provided a stage for Asian sides to flourish in its short history and host India's scintillating form leading up to the tournament will only fuel local hopes that the trend will continue.</strongIndia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have won three out of the five stagings of the biennial tournament, while the 2010 final was the only one that did not feature a team from South Asia.Former players and pundits have been united in endorsing India, who won the 50-over World Cup at home in 2011, as favourites to add a second World Twenty20 title to their cabinet and given the side's run of form, it is hardly surprising.Mahendra Singh Dhoni's men have won 10 of the 11 Twenty20 contests they have played this year, including a 3-0 win in Australia, and have looked supremely balanced with their often-soft bowling attack also showing plenty of bite.The only worry for India's fanatical cricket following will be that the team have peaked too early and they will be desperately hoping that the law of averages catches up with them after the final at Kolkata's Eden Gardens on April 3.While India have enjoyed a relatively trouble-free build up to the tournament, it has been far from smooth sailing for fellow Asian contenders Pakistan and Sri Lanka.Pakistan, the 2009 champions, arguably have the most potent pace attack with left-arm fast bowler Mohammad Amir seamlessly integrating into the side after a five-year spot-fixing ban.But Shahid Afridi's men have had troubles with their top-order, prompting the selectors to twice tinker with the squad and a row over security leading to a venue change for the highly charged India match will not have helped matters.Defending champions Sri Lanka have failed to adequately replace retired batting stalwarts Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene after their 2014 World Twenty20 triumph and were forced to install Angelo Mathews as their new captain this week.The island nation have lost recent series against New Zealand, India and a woeful Asia Cup display led to the sacking of the entire selection panel.The team and their supporters will keep their fingers crossed on the fitness of pace spearhead Lasith Malinga, who relinquished the captaincy due to the slow recovery of his injured knee but insists he can still play a part.strong>AUSTRALIA'S T20 CONUNDRUM</strongAustralia will look to end their lack of success in the format and add the T20 title to their 50-over World Cup triumph on home soil last year, banking on their explosive batting line-up to make up for the lack of a potent spinner.They have not left anything to chance though, replacing Aaron Finch with test and one-day international skipper Steve Smith to lead the side, who have had a number of players plying their trade in the Indian Premier League (IPL) over the years.Another side hoping the experience of playing in the IPL will come in handy for their players will be South Africa, who once again will be determined to shed their 'chokers' tag at another global championship.AB de Villiers, believed by most to be the most destructive batsman in world cricket, has often entertained crowds in India during the IPL with his 360 degree batting and South Africa will hope the 32-year-old can end their wait for a World Cup title.strong>FEARLESS ENGLAND</strongJos Buttler, Alex Hales and Eoin Morgan will believe they can be match de Villiers' pyrotechnics for England but the 2010 champions' bowling attack appears short of experience.They also have a powerful striker in Ben Stokes and the dependable Joe Root with the willow but it is to be seen if the batting can gloss over their bowling shortcomings.Fellow contenders New Zealand may have a few psychological issues to resolve if they are to overcome their tendency to come up short on the big stage.Their preparations have been overshadowed by the recent death of former captain Martin Crowe while the retirement of Brendon McCullum has robbed them of an exceptional reader of the game with unbridled batting firepower.Darren Sammy will also have to inspire an understrength West Indies team, who just weeks ago were planning to boycott the tournament over a contractual dispute, if the 2012 champions are to stand any chance of winning a second title.",3/12/2016,India favoured to keep Asia on top in WC T20,sports

"DHARAMSALA: Netherland defeated Ireland in a dead rubber curtailed by rain to six-overs-a-side World Twenty qualifiers Group A match here on Sunday.Netherland after sent into bat, made 59 for five in six overs and later restricted Ireland to 47 for seven to win the match by 12 runs.There was snow on the mountain tops in Himachal Pradesh, if the drizzle had cleared the temperatures were plunging and Ireland felt the chill as once they were again tormented by the side in orange.The orange flash at deep midwicket that sparkled most brightly of all came 14 balls into Ireland's pursuit of 60 and belonged to Pieter Seelaar as he sprinted along the midwicket boundary before clinging to a slick diving catch.Paul van Meekeren banged the ball in back of a length, Kevin O'Brien's pull was middled, but the shot that might have broken the run chase (had it gone for six Ireland would have been 34 for 1 after 14 balls) was instead the harbinger of Ireland's growing despondency.As for van Meekeren, a return of 4 for 11 will awaken a little interest, one suspects, in English county cricket. By the time he began the final over, Ireland were still 20 short, and he demolished the stumps of Max Sorensen and George Dockrell to ensure there was no monkey business.Both sides were already eliminated but Netherlands were happy to get the consolation win..Only one Ireland player was allowed to bowl two overs and Dockrell's left-arm spin proved to be a wise choice, registering 3 for 7, and producing catching opportunities from three of his first five balls, two of which were taken. Seven dot balls out of 12, including an over in the Powerplay, was an astounding effort that might have brought victory.Dockrell found turn all the same as Netherlands' batsmen floundered against him. Tom Cooper slogged his third ball to mid-on, affording the opportunity to prey upon Roelof van der Merwe who was promoted to No. 3.It did not work out for van der Merwe. Twice, he slogged Dockrell's left-arm spin to the legside. Kevin O'Brien spilled the first - a slice to long-off and a grimace from O'Brien as he landed heavily, but van der Merwe's next attempt was entirely bungled and he fell off the cue end at short third man.The coup de grace came in Dockrell's second over when his turn outdid Wesley Barresi as he came down the pitch, leaving Niall O'Brien with a simple stumping.Stephan Myburgh was dropped on 9 by Paul Stirling at deep midwicket but was still restrict to 27 from 18 balls. When he was run out against the penultimate ball, the damage had been limited. Dockrell bowled only one ball at him - the first ball of his spell - and got away with a leg bye off his waist.Stirling addressed Ireland's chase when he twice walked across his stumps in Tim van der Gugten's first over to flick him over fine leg for six. But Seelaar's thrilling intervention changed the complexion of the game and Stirling fell to the next ball, his ramp shot was collected at third man.At 28.3 off 2.3, Ireland had opportunity even in a six-over game for a settling period, but their plight worsened when Gary Wilson and Stuart Poynter departed against van der Merwe within three balls - Wilson falling to a reverse sweep, Poynton skying a rustic slog.With 25 needed from two, and only five wickets remaining, Netherlands were suddenly favourites.

"strong>NAGPUR: New Zealand are bracing for a trial by spin when they open their World Twenty20 campaign against hosts India on Tuesday, skipper Kane Williamson said on the eve of their Super 10 fixture.</strongThe Indian team have been widely touted as firm favourites to win the biennial event due to their knowledge about the conditions at home and a strong run of form in the buildup to the tournament.New Zealand, though, have defeated India in all their previous four meetings in the shortest format of the game but their progress was somewhat thwarted against England's spinners on Saturday in their warm-up match.""We certainly are expecting spin to pay a big part in this tournament,"" Williamson told reporters on Monday, adding their past record against India would have no bearing on the match.""I suppose judging by the warm-up games in Mumbai, they had a bit for the seamers and it swung a little bit.""They were very good surfaces but from what cricket we have seen here in Nagpur, spin looks likely to play a big part. It's important that we adjust our gameplan accordingly.""Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin will lead India's slow bowling attack along with Ravindra Jadeja while part-timer Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina are also expected to chip in.New Zealand arrived at the tournament after a preparatory camp in Dubai, having played a two-test home series against Australia, during which former captain Brendon McCullum retired from international cricket.Williamson was confident there would not be any problems making the switch to the 20-over format.""We go into the match tomorrow with a clean slate.

Javeria was immediately stretchered off the field and taken to a nearby hospital. Javeria underwent a CT scan, and is understood to now be conscious.Sidra Ameen and Bismah Maroof steadied the innings with a patient 40-run stand, but three quick blows from Mohammed swung the contest decisively West Indies way. First, Mohammed removed Ameed in the ninth over before proceeding to dismiss both Aliya Riyaz and Maroof in the 11th. It left Pakistan needing 60 off the last 56 balls, but the momentum was in West Indies' hands. Muneeba Ali (15), Sana Mir (18) and Asmavia Iqbal (19) all chipped in with handy knocks to keep Pakistan in sight of the target, but their slow run-rate left the team needing 12 off the final over, bowled by Deandra Dottin.Dottin conceded three off the first ball, but Pakistan failed to find the boundaries - the team managed just five in their entire innings - as West Indies hung on to open their account.

"India's cricket team is undoubtedly, indisputably, unarguably, and by a massive distance, better than Pakistan's cricket team. At football.It was probably the only definitive bit of knowledge anyone could have gleaned from watching the two teams' training sessions on the eve of their World T20 clash at the Eden Gardens. If Saturday's big match involved goalposts and a large, inflated ball, India would lose no sleep over it.It is, instead, a cricket match. And not just any cricket match. It is the cricket match that causes a spike in the frequency of Venkatesh Prasad sightings on Indian television in the days leading up to it. And of Aamer Sohail and Kiran More and Javed Miandad and Ajay Jadeja and Waqar Younis and Joginder Sharma and Misbah-ul-Haq.It is an India-Pakistan clash at a World tournament, and it will come with the inevitable trappings. Famous people will sing national anthems. Massive names will be present among the massive numbers in attendance. Sachin Tendulkar will be there. So will Imran Khan. And Sunil Gavaskar. And Wasim Akram. And Kapil Dev. And Inzamam-ul-Haq.In the middle of all this, India and Pakistan, the cricket teams, will try and tune out the constant swirl of India-Pakistan.R Ashwin reinforced this during his pre-match conference on Friday, in a packed and insufficiently air-conditioned media room that evoked the pressure cooker clich�.""This rivalry is huge,"" he said. ""It's very hard to put a finger [on it] and say how huge it is. It's probably bigger than the Ashes is. As far as the Indians go and the Pakistanis go, I don't think they watch this as a game of cricket. It's more of a border rivalry, they want to get one up on each other.""So there is much more to this game rather than the game itself taking centrestage. As far as people are concerned, they put their emotions into it. For the players it's about trying to keep the emotions aside and playing the game the best we can.""It is something India have invariably managed to do against Pakistan at World events. In six World Cup meetings and four in the World T20, they have never lost. It's the sort of record that can put pressure on both sides, but on this occasion India are under more of it, given that they are playing at home, and given that they were beaten soundly by New Zealand in their first game and therefore have to win this one. Over recent years, Pakistan have usually been underdogs going into matches against India, and on this occasion have the cushion of a big win in their opening game against Bangladesh.""History can change, too,"" Waqar Younis, Pakistan's head coach, said. ""We are confident, a little more this time because [India] can go out of the tournament also. They will be under a lot of pressure. We have to take it positively. We have won the last match, so there are lots of things going in our favour, hopefully. Yes, there is no doubt that our history hasn't been so good but history can always be changed.""In all the previous games, the pressure was on Pakistani team. This is the first time that the pressure is more on India - not arising from victory or defeat at the hands of Pakistan but because this is a very big tournament. I have been a cricketer all my years and it is impossible that India won't be feeling the pressure. I am sure they will be feeling the pressure and we are going to take advantage of that.""India arrived in Kolkata on Wednesday night, but only had an optional training session - which only Suresh Raina, Ajinkya Rahane and Pawan Negi attended - on Thursday. Their first full session ahead of the match was on its eve. Ashwin said the light schedule was followed to allow the players to relax after the loss to New Zealand, and not put themselves under too much pressure.""I think it was more about trying and relaxing,"" he said. ""It had nothing to do with who we are playing, what game we are playing and all that. We have been on the road for the last three months and we thought it's time now to sit in the hotel room and revisit what we did in the last game. The best thing that we can do is to think for ourselves than sitting together and practising.""What happens after a game like that is we tend to go into nervous practice, try and overdo everything, and eventually end up going into the match a little more tired than we actually should be. That's the idea behind it.""India's practice session on Friday reflected this mindset, with the bowlers hardly taxing themselves and only the middle-order trio of Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni and Hardik Pandya spending any real length of time batting. Pakistan - after their unconvincing footballing warm-up - had a more traditional nets session, with the fast bowlers coming off their full run-ups and sending down a relatively large quota of deliveries.Two training philosophies, neither definitely better or worse than the other, both geared to the same end: to keep minds focused on bat and ball, to tune out the crowds and the last-minute venue changes and the razzmatazz of the build-up. As Virat Kohli said before the start of the tournament, ""On the field is the safest and quietest place for you"". And until they actually get on the field, the match will live a parallel existence that has little to do with the actual cricket. It might as well be a football game where Mohammad Irfan and a magically young-again Venkatesh Prasad are goalkeepers in a penalty shootout.",3/18/2016,India Pakistan look to tune out India Pakistan hy,sports
"NAGPUR: Australia began their title defence with a six-wicket win against South Africa at the VCA Stadium in Nagpur. It was vice-captain Alex Blackwell and captain Meg Lanning who led the way to chase down 103 easily in the end, after they were reduced to 9 for 3 in the fourth over.South Africa had an excellent launch pad at 69 without loss in 12 overs after opting to bat. Then they fell into a crater courtesy rush of blood, indecision against spin and a number of misguided strokes to huff and puff to 102 for 6. As hard as they tried, defending it was never going to be easy against the masters of the big occasion who are gunning for their fourth successive title.Eventually, the batting meltdown played a big part in the result, as Lanning and Blackwell allayed fears with an unbroken 52-run fifth-wicket stand off just 38 balls to see Australia home with nine balls to spare.South Africa showed they were up for a fight as Dane van Niekerk did the early running by making 45 in a 72-run opening stand with Trisha Chetty, before Australia strangulated them.While Ellyse Perry hustled the batsmen with pace, Lauren Cheatle's canny variations resulted in South Africa's middle order having to manufacture strokes that didn't connect. Chetty's scratchy 34 eventually helped them cross the 100-run mark.Australia's thoughts of the chase being a walk in the park were firmly put on the backburner. Alyssa Healy walked across to flick, only to find her leg stump flattened to give the fired-up Shabnim Ismail an early sniff. Perry bottom-edged a cut to the wicketkeeper, while Ellyse Villani chopped on to leave Australia in tatters before they could reach double figures.Lanning's illness that kept her off the field for most parts of South Africa's innings meant she could come in either after 30 minutes or the fall of the fifth wicket. But the conclusion of Ismail's opening burst took with it the sting in their attack as Blackwell and Jess Jonassen added 44 for the fourth wicket. When Jonassen stepped out to be stumped, the game was back in the balance as Australia slipped to 53 for 4, needing 50 off 47 balls.Lanning struggled to run as she helped herself to three fours to bring the equation down to 23 off the last four overs. Once within striking distance, the feared white-ball striker in her surfaced as she hit Ismail for two fierce square cuts, to convert a tricky chase into a cruise.��",3/18/2016,Australia women record easy win over South Africa ,sports

"MOHALI: Suzie Bates' swift 60-ball 82 and her 104-run partnership with Sophie Devine for the second wicket set the base for New Zealand Women's massive 93-run win over Ireland Women in the World T20 match in Mohali.New Zealand got off to a blistering start after opting to bat, as opener Rachel Priest struck three fours in the first over before falling to medium-pacer Amy Kenealy in the second over.The wicket brought Bates and Devine together at the crease, and the pair built on the early momentum in their century stand. By the end of the Powerplay, New Zealand were 48 for one and except for a couple of quiet overs, the pair found the boundary with ease.Devine fell in the 15th over to Isobel Joyce, after a 34-ball 47, and Bates then propelled the score past 150.The New Zealand captain struck two successive sixes off Kim Garth in the penultimate over before falling for 82; her knock also included seven fours.She became the fourth player to score more than 2000 runs in women's T20I cricket and is second on the list of highest run-getters with 2063 runs, ahead of Sarah Taylor and Stafanie Taylor.Ireland's chase simply failed to get off the blocks. They lost two wickets within the first four overs for a score of 16 and by the tenth over had reached only 34 for 3.The required run rate was already more than 14 by that stage and it was only Joyce who showed some resistance with a 33-ball 28, the top score in an Ireland innings that eventually petered out to 84 for 5.Offspinner Leigh Kasperek had economical returns of 1-10 in her four overs while legspinner Erin Bermingham took 2 for 17.�",3/18/2016,New Zealand crush Ireland in Womens World T20,sports

"MUMBAI: South Africa survived a spirited Afghanistan chase to defend a 200-plus score and get their World Twenty20 campaign back on track.Chris Morris and Imran Tahir squeezed through the middle period to ensure AB de Villiers' quickfire 64 was not in vain, he took 29 runs off Rashid Khan, which ended up being the major difference between the two sides.In the end, South Africa will be relieved that they were able to defend their total, but disappointed that the margin of victory was not bigger. They tightened up on their discipline in the field but still gave away more extras than their opposition - six wides compared to two from Afghanistan - and did not show the kind of killer instinct that they will need later in the tournament.They also suffered an injury concern. JP Duminy left the field four balls into Afghanistan's chase with a hamstring strain and was unable to take any further part in the match. Duminy has only just found form again and his availability will be important for the rest of the World T20.Quinton de Kock picked up from where he left off two days ago and dominated the opening passages of play. Hashim Amla may have wanted to catch up but after one four, gifted a catch to Asghar Stanikzai at mid-off.South Africa held de Villiers back and sent in Faf du Plessis at No.3. The strategy worked. Du Plessis took on the spin from Mohammad Nabi while de Kock continued to attack in the Powerplay. South Africa finished it on 66 for 1 and 60 of those runs came in boundaries.When the fielding restrictions were lifted, Rashid put the brakes on with the first boundary-less over of the innings, but du Plessis did not want things to slow down too much. He picked up the pace before being run-out and de Villiers was soon at the crease.Afghanistan were not under threat immediately while de Villiers settled in and de Kock nicked off. After conceding just 19 runs in three overs after the halfway stage of the South African innings, Afghanistan might have been hopeful of pulling South Africa even further back. But Duminy and de Villiers were wise to the need to accelerate and began to push for runs.It was up to David Miller to take them to 200 after de Villiers was dismissed. Twenty runs off the final over ensured South Africa had a second straight 200-plus score.However, Mohammad Shahzad threatened to gun down that total all by himself. He began fearlessly against Kagiso Rabada and Kyle Abbott and plundered 32 runs off the first two overs. His partner Noor Ali Zadran did not face a ball until the third over and then, it was only to return the strike to Shahzad.Morris was brought on in the fourth over and showed improvement from previous performances. He started by holding his length back but then steamed in with a delivery just under 150kph - full and straightening - which splayed Shahzad's stumps.Asghar Stanikzai and was caught behind in Morris' next over but Gulbadin Naib kept Afghanistan in it and targeted David Wiese, South Africa's replacement for Steyn. Afghanistan reached 10 overs on 103 for 2, 11 runs ahead of where South Africa were at the same stage. Then, Gulbadin was caught behind, Noor Ali was stumped, and Afghanistan were wobbling, still needing 100 runs off eight overs. Their chase was over then and South Africa had the chance to drill home an advantage.Instead, they allowed Afghanistan to drag it out. Abbott and Morris got the yorker right more often than they did in previous matches and Rabada managed one at the end, but South Africa will not feel it was a complete performance by any means. �",3/20/2016,South Africa defend 200 plus total to beat Afghani,sports

"strong>Pakistan did all they could to get their World Twenty20 match against India moved to Kolkata, even threatening to withdraw, but poor selection and the hosts� all-round superiority left them wishing they had not bothered to turn up at all.</strongThe most anticipated match of the tournament between the neighbours was shifted to Eden Gardens at the last moment over security concerns at the original venue at Dharamsala.Pakistan repeatedly emphasised India�s morale-sapping loss in the opener against New Zealand was an advantage for them and they were even more confident of breaking their jinx of losing every World Cup match between the bitter rivals.Their decision to play four fast bowlers against India reflected an approach more suited to the 1980s West Indies side and dropping spinner Imad Wasim at the expense of a paceman underlined their failure to read the surface.Asked to bat in the rain-shortened Group Two match, the 2009 champions were largely subdued once off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin got the new ball to turn viciously.Doubts seemed to creep into Pakistan�s minds regarding what would be a decent target to set India, who folded for 79 against the Kiwis on a turning track while chasing 127 in their opener, and the innings never gained momentum until the death overs.MEAGRE TOTAL""There are few areas we need to improve, specially our batting,"" said Shoaib Malik, who top-scored with a 26 for Pakistan.""Even though it was a tough pitch to bat on, I believe we could have set a higher target.""In the end, Pakistan could only manage a meagre 118 for five in their 18 overs, nowhere near enough without the bowling depth New Zealand could draw upon in Nagpur when their spinners picked up nine of 10 wickets to stun India.India did suffer a minor wobble though, slumping to 23-3 after Mohammad Sami dismissed Shikhar Dhawan and Suresh Raina in consecutive deliveries in the fifth over to silence the 60,000 crowd at Eden Gardens as well as the millions watching on TV.However, India�s batting mainstay Virat Kohli hit a prudent 55 not out to calm the nerves and showed why he is considered one of the world�s best.The right-hander, who averages almost 85 in T20s against Pakistan, was aided by the fact that he did not have to face too many deliveries from Mohammad Amir, whose opening spell of 1-3 ran shivers down India�s spines.The left-arm paceman was not brought back on by Shahid Afridi until India were nearing victory and the leg-spinning skipper, who lacks the guile to turn the ball effectively, was unable to stem the flow of runs himself.As the pressure lifted, India were easily able to maintain their utter dominance of Pakistan in World Cup events, adding a fifth World Twenty20 victory to the six triumphs in the 50-over format.",3/20/2016,Pakistan fail to show up as India revive campaig,sports

"strong>NEW DELHI: England skipper Eoin Morgan would like to believe his team peaked at the right time at the ongoing World Twenty20 while New Zealand were slightly premature going into Wednesday�s semi-final at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium.</strongKane Williamson and his Kiwi team mates have not put a foot wrong since landing in India, winning all four group matches without really breaking a sweat to qualify for the semi-finals as the tournament�s only unbeaten team.For a side boasting an explosive batting order and a balanced attack to go with, England�s passage proved bumpier.Even before they could soak in the atmosphere, England were blown away by a Chris Gayle century in their tournament opener against West Indies in Mumbai.Joe Root sparked their recovery in the 230-run chase against South Africa but the narrow victory against Afghanistan�s modest resources exposed their frailties against spin bowling.They looked a significantly better side, however, in Saturday�s 10-run win against champions Sri Lanka.Jos Buttler underlined his limited overs worth with a belligerent fifty, the pacemen made regular inroads, Ben Stokes delivered a tidy final over and the team held their nerve to secure a victory that seemed to tick most of the boxes.""In these tight tournaments you can�t get through to the semis unless you are playing good cricket, and that�s what we set out to do to give ourselves a chance,"" coach Trevor Bayliss said.""But it�s about peaking at the right time.I wouldn�t say we�ve played the perfect game yet -- coaches are always looking for that absolutely perfect game, I don�t think it�s ever been played -- but it�s what any team is striving to do.""Having played their last two games at Kotla, England would also hope to cash in on their familiarity with the venue in contrast to their opponents who were on a mini-tour of India playing each of their four group games at different venues.strong>KIWI ADAPTABILITY</strongThe trouble for England, however, is that New Zealand won all of them as the team, finalists in last year�s 50-over World Cup, strive to shed the tag of being cricket�s perennial bridesmaid.Leading from the front, Williamson has also displayed the tactical flexibility needed to win a tournament like this.New Zealand sprang a surprise in their tournament opener, picking three spinners in a gutsy gamble and went on to beat India, renowned for their batsmen�s comfort against the turning ball, in their own game.Williamson repeated the ploy against Bangladesh in their final group match for a similar result, his immaculate pitch assessment in stark contrast to most of the visiting captains who struggled to read the track as if it was in Braille.Left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner and leg-spinner Ish Sodhi have already forged a formidable partnership for the Kiwis, claiming 17 wickets between them in four matches.And if Williamson has noticed England�s struggle against Afghanistan�s slow bowlers, the Kiwi captain will be tempted to harness Nathan McCullum�s control and accuracy in a three-pronged spin attack.As demonstrated by Martin Guptill, the Kiwi batting does not lack firepower but what was more heart-warming for the fans is how batsmen like Colin Munro have tempered strokes according to situations.""It hasn�t been the wham, bam...sort of way that T20 cricket has been,"" batting coach Craig McMillan said after the victory against Bangladesh in their last group match.""They have had to assess it...and have done a really good job of putting the runs on the board to give the bowlers something to work with.""",3/29/2016,WT20 Peaking England meet soaring Kiwis in first semi,sports

New Zealand's surprise package - the spinners Mitchell Santner and Ish Sodhi - still lay in wait.The pitch appeared to have a little grass, but given the venue's history that did not mean there would be much response for bowlers of any type. England's two previous games, against Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, had been played on slowish surfaces, one dry and slow, one damper and a little quicker, but neither offered much turn.Almost no one would have expected New Zealand to leave both Trent Boult and Tim Southee out for the entire group stage, yet the semi-final had arrived and they were excluded once more.England: Alex Hales, Jason Roy, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan (captain), Jos Buttler (wk), Ben Stokes, Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid, Chris Jordan, David Willey, Liam PlunkettNew Zealand: Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson (captain), Colin Munro, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi (wk), Mitchell Santner, Adam Milne, Ish Sodhi, Mitchell McClenaghan�",3/30/2016,England bowl against New Zealand in World T20 first SF,sports

"strong>MUMBAI: The second World Twenty20 semi-final is likely to hinge on who emerges on top in the battle between the big-hitting West Indian batsmen and India�s wily spinners when the former champions clash at the Wankhede Stadium on Thursday.</strongIndia, the world�s top-ranked side in the shortest format, arrived at the sixth edition of the tournament with 10 wins from 11 matches in 2016 and were considered overwhelming favourites by fans, opposing captains and bookmakers alike.But while an opening Super 10 stage defeat to New Zealand, who reached the semi-finals unbeaten, was a wake-up call, the home side�s credentials came into question in a one-run win over Bangladesh, who lost three wickets in the last three balls.Virat Kohli�s wide blade was then called on to see off a stiff challenge from 50-over world champions Australia in a winner-takes-all contest to reach the last four, his masterclass glossing over some major batting flaws for the 2007 champions.Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma have failed to build a solid foundation for the hosts and their opening stands of five, 14, 42 and 23 have put pressure on the middle and lower order to provide a bulk of the scoring.Left-hander Suresh Raina�s scores of one, zero, 30 and 10 have not been overly helpful either, and calls for the number four batsman�s omission from the team have only gained momentum.Yuvraj Singh�s ankle injury in the win over Australia could open the door for Ajinkya Rahane to play at his home ground in Mumbai but the right-hander may be a little rusty, having not been involved in an international match for more than a month.""You can�t rely on one batsman, yes the others have contributed, but still at the same time, if we can do a bit more with the bat at the top of the order and the middle overs, I think we will feel the pressure slightly less,"" India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said after the Australia triumph.""Also, it will be good, because still we feel we are batting at 65 percent, barring Virat (Kohli).""strong>CAPTAIN COOL</strongDhoni faces the prospect of lifting a third World Cup for India after leading them in 2007 and again for the 50-overs title in 2011, the wicketkeeper lauded for his exceptional calmness and savvy against Bangladesh as India stole victory.A win on Thursday will take India to a third final in the World Twenty20 under Dhoni after they went down to South Asian rivals Sri Lanka in the last edition in Bangladesh.The strong form of his spinners and accuracy of pacemen Ashish Nehra and Jasprit Bumrah in the death overs will give Dhoni hope of taming the West Indies batsmen on a surface that has done little to help the bowlers in three matches.South Africa saw a 230-run target chased down by England, who were on the receiving end of Chris Gayle�s assault when they failed to defend a score of 182.At the same ground, Afghanistan gave South Africa a scare while chasing 209 until they lost too many wickets in the second half of the innings on a surface offering little respite for the bowlers at a ground with relatively short boundaries.Afghanistan also inflicted the only Super 10 defeat on West Indies with their spinners finding a way to restrict their powerful batsmen in Nagpur.The 2012 champions rested Gayle for that game and a hamstring injury to Andre Fletcher, who has since been ruled out of the tournament and replaced by Lendl Simmons, hampered their chase further.But the inability to chase down a modest 124 would have not gone unnoticed and skipper Darren Sammy is hoping it was just a one-off and not a sign of inconsistency.""We have to leave this game in Nagpur,"" Sammy said.""We�ll leave this game here and see it as the blip in the tournament.""Now we have two knockouts to play.

Since then, he has scored nine further runs.He was dismissed for five in the semi-final against India before Simmons smashed 82 from 51 balls, while Andre Russell scored 43 from 20 to guide their side into Sunday's showdown with Eoin Morgan's team in Kolkata on Sunday.""I think England will certainly be aware that it's not a one-man show in this team,"" Simmons told reporters.""Chris Gayle didn't get off but we still managed to get over the line and it was a big total.""Even when he didn't perform, we were still able to get up and fight and that shows a lot of character from our players.""The team have needed to rely on their character and collective will after a turbulent few months in which they have been pilloried for their performances in test matches and one day internationals.They have also been galvanised by yet another bitter pay dispute with their board, who less than two months ago threatened to send a second string side to the tournament in India unless the squad accepted their offer.Since Gayle's blistering start to the tournament, others have assumed the mantle of trying to chase down the totals they have been set in all five games.Andre Fletcher scored 84 not out in their seven-wicket win over Sri Lanka, while Johnson Charles (32) and Marlon Samuels (43) saw them to a three-wicket win over South Africa.""Every one of our players are match winners in our team,"" Simmons added. ""We have a lot of batting power and I think we can chase any run total, we always back ourselves to chase totals.""That confidence has also been evident in Morgan's side after they comfortably accounted for New Zealand in the other semi-final, with man of the match Jason Roy epitomising the aggressive attitude that has filtered through the team.That aggression, and confidence, made them a better outfit than the England team that won the World Twenty20 in 2010, according to the captain of that side, Paul Collingwood.""In the past our line-up probably had one or two players that were real match-winners, this team is full of match-winners,"" Collingwood told the ECB website.""These guys are mentally different to what we used to be.

It is therefore a priority to have all of our players competing and available for selection.�Relations between the board and team have often been poisonous in recent years with players furious over what they see as inadequate financial rewards.A pay dispute two years ago led to the team flying home in the middle of a tour of India and the players only reluctantly agreed to sign contracts for the World T20 a few weeks before the tournament began.Many senior players, such as Chris Gayle, no longer play Test matches instead turning out in T20 leagues where they can earn more money in six weeks than they are paid by their board in a year.When the West Indies were thrashed by Australia in a Test series at the turn of the year, Gayle and Sammy were both unavailable for selection as they were playing in Australia�s Big Bash T20 tournament.Amid growing fears that the proliferation of T20 leagues is turning some players away from Test matches, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has said it wants to draw up a time table to avoid clashes.Many of the West Indies T20 champions are expected to play in the IPL which begins this coming weekend and ends in late May.�We are aware of that schedule hence the plan to meet at that time�, �said Cameron. �We will also engage the ICC on this so that we protect not only the rich heritage and legacy of West Indies cricket but also its future�, he added.",4/4/2016,Windies board offers talks with new T20 ,sports

Did it hamper them? It didn't look like, as Andre Russell and Brad Hogg took three wickets apiece to skittle Delhi Daredevils for 98.

"MOHALI: Aaron Finch and Dwayne Bravo helped Gujarat Lions ease into the IPL with a thumping win against Kings XI Punjab in Mohali, the third one-sided affair of the season in three games.Barring the first over, Lions were in total control of the 162 chase after Finch set it up with his first IPL fifty since 2014.Brendon McCullum, fresh off a whirlwind ton in his last Test, danced down the track off Sandeep Sharma in the first over with keeper Wriddhiman Saha standing up.Sandeep, though, anticipated a forward shimmy and bowled the perfect outswinger to leave McCullum stranded. Finch and Suresh Raina then took the attack to the pacers, both capitalizing on loose deliveries along with intermittent swipes.After Raina holed out to mid-on in the sixth over, Finch peppered the boundary with deft touch and exemplary placement, particular behind square on the off side.His 47-ball 74 saw 12 boundaries, and it required a moment of brilliance from the debutant Pardeep Sahu to remove him. Sahu drew Finch forward but the legspinner beat him in flight and loop, as Saha completed his second stumping off the innings.The rest of the innings was a mere formality as Dinesh Karthik accrued his runs in typical fashion, with his sweeps being the most productive.Kings XI were given an ideal start by their openers - M Vijay and Manan Vohra - who saw off the swinging new ball before getting stuck into their work. A blend of crisp drives and flicks earned the pair a fifty-run stand within the Powerplay.The spreading field did not impede Vohra, as he manufactured boundaries with the use of his feet off the spinners.However, momentum shifted rapidly as Ravindra Jadeja struck twice in consecutive overs to remove the openers. Dwayne Bravo undid Glenn Maxwell and David Miller in the space of three balls with contrasting yorkers.Bravo became the first bowler to 300 T20 wickets with his new weapon - the slow, dipping yorker that deceived Miller.Suddenly, debutant Marcus Stoinis and Wriddhiman Saha were left to rebuild a rollicking start. The pair were forced to use the large Mohali pockets to find their runs, but struggled to find the boundaries towards the end. Much of that was down to the efficiency of the Lions bowlers, who executed their yorkers and slower balls.Bravo took two more wickets off consecutive slower balls in the last over, and could have had his best T20 bowling figures had Sarabjit Ladda pouched a skier off the last ball. Just two boundaries and 36 runs were scored off the last five overs, and Kings XI could muster 161.",4/11/2016,Gujrat begin IPL campaign with 5 wkt win over Punjab,sports

"KOLKATA: Mitchell McClenaghan walked out at No. 4 for Mumbai Indians. It is not like the side is short of hitters but Jos Buttler caught fire only after the spark provided by McClenaghan's eight-ball 20. The events between the 11th and the 15th overs of the chase decided the winner of the match - Mumbai, by six wickets.McClenaghan's responsibility - under normal circumstances - was to slip into Lasith Malinga's shoes. Be the wicket-taker at the start and the enforcer at the end. Today, he was asked to disrupt the Kolkata Knight Riders' rhythm. And he was given the freedom to do so. Every single shot played by the New Zealand fast bowler was a slog. His second, third and fourth balls cleared the Eden Gardens boundaries. The eighth - a wide full toss that he tried to slog sweep - led to his downfall but by then Mumbai had regained lost momentum. And Buttler simply ran with it.A straight drive against chinaman Brad Hogg was followed by a pulled six. The equation shrunk from 101 off 60 balls to 49 off 30. A scoop to the fine leg boundary - which established Buttler's finesse - and two lofted cover drives - which established his power - deflated Knight Riders. Gautam Gambhir, who had taken the record (27) for the most fifties in the IPL earlier in the night, watched the ball soar and the chances for his team sink with every minute Buttler was on strike.When Buttler eventually fell for 41 off 22 balls, the Mumbai captain, Rohit Sharma, back at his preferred opening position, provided more evidence of why he should be given as many overs as possible in a T20 game. Rohit held the innings together and even finished it off with an array of beautiful shots - a straight six and a deft glide to third man. He followed those up with an outrageous sweep taking an overpitched delivery coming at him with the express pace of Andre Russell from around the wicket, and deposited it at the midwicket boundary.

"BANGALORE: Royal Challengers Bangalore blasted the first 200-plus score of the tournament in an emphatic 45-run win over Sunrisers Hyderabad at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium. In doing so, they also bucked the season's early trend of chasing teams prevailing.AB de Villiers (82) and Virat Kohli (75) provided a visual treat courtesy a fine cocktail of fineness and brute force in a 157-run second-wicket stand, before Shane Watson announced himself by muscling three successive sixes in an over from Karn Sharma. The final flourish was lent by Sarfaraz Khan, who in his typically unorthodox fashion, paddled and reverse-paddled his way to an unbeaten 10-ball 35 as Royal Challengers finished with 227 for 4.Deflated and dejected, Sunrisers went for broke, wiping out 83 for the loss of Shikhar Dhawan in eight overs. David Warner, who returned to open after a brief flirtation in the middle order with Australia in the World T20, showed why he is one of the most feared white-ball strikers. He muscled three sixes and five fours in a 21-ball half-century before falling into the short-ball trap laid by Watson.The pressure of the required rate eventually got to Sunrisers and the chase went cold as the team lost Warner, Naman Ojha, Henriques and Deepak Hooda in the space of 17 deliveries, meaning they could only muster 182 for 6. Parvez Rasool was the pick of Royal Challengers' bowlers, returning 1 for 31 in a crafty spell of offspin bowling, even as Watson and Yuzvendra Chahal, the legspiner, chipped away with two wickets.Chris Gayle's dismissal for 1 in the second over of the match to Bhuvneshwar Kumar, when the ball brushed the thigh pad and deflected onto the leg stump, was a rare moment to cheer for a listless Sunrisers bowling attack that was further depleted when Ashish Nehra, their pace spearhead, hobbled off the field after just 2.1 overs. That resulted in a batting feast for two men in a murderous mood as Royal Challengers blasted 139 off the last 10 overs.The only semblance of respect from Kohli and de Villiers came early on when Mustafizur Rahman, making his IPL debut, troubled them with his cutters. Once the job of seeing off his initial burst - a two-over spell - was done, they let loose. Sarfaraz's unbeaten 44-run stand off just 15 deliveries with Kedar Jadhav ensured Royal Challengers had momentum firmly by their side at the break.Dhawan's early wicket to Rasool was a setback for Sunrisers, but Warner's muscle kept his team in the hunt as Kohli rang in the changes in a bid to pull things back. Adam Milne's second spell, in which he had Moises Henriques mistime a pull to midwicket, opened the game up. Once Royal Challengers had one foot in the door, it was a simple matter of forcing it open, which they did quite easily. In the end, even Ashish Reddy's big hitting was merely a footnote for Sunrisers in what was a forgettable outing.�",4/13/2016,RCB crush Sunrisers after hitting 227 4,sports

In such cases, athletes �could not reasonably have known or suspected� that the drug would still be present in their bodies after 1 January, said WADA in a �clarification paper� to its code signatories on how they should prosecute meldonium cases.�In these circumstances Wada considers that there may be grounds for no fault or negligence on the part of the athlete,� it added.

Our margin for error has run out and we are aware of the challenge.""Now we have a marvellous challenge, five games in which if we win them all we are champions""Barca started brightly, but were repeatedly denied by fine saves from Valencia goalkeeper Diego Alves.The Brazilian blocked Messi's volley from close range before somehow springing to punch away Neymar's lob which seemed destined to evade him.However, Valencia amazingly went in at half-time two goals to the good having had just one shot on target.The visitors went in front on 27 minutes when Rakitic turned Guilherme Siqueira's cross into his own net at the near post and doubled their lead thanks to a brilliant move in first-half stoppage time as Dani Parejo played in Mina to fire into the far corner.Rakitic had a huge chance to make amends for his own goal a minute into the second-half, but pulled his effort tamely wide from Luis Suarez's fine cut-back.However, Barca were finally given hope when Jordi Alba's low cross was turned home by Messi to reach another historic landmark.Alves came to Valencia's rescue once more with his best save of the night low to his right to prevent Rakitic equalising 15 minutes from time.Neymar's fiercely struck volley was somehow deflected behind by Shkodran Mustafi, but Valencia should also have killed the game off at the other end when Paco Alcacer miscued from point-blank range allowing Sergio Busquets to clear off the line.Gerard Pique then had a glorious chance to salvage at least a point late on, but he pulled his shot wide with just Alves to beat.In contrast to Barca's collapse, Atletico are flying in the final stages of the season as Fernando Torres struck his fourth goal in as many games in a routine win over Granada.""It will be tough (to win the league), but we will play as the schedule demands us to which is to win, win and win again,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone.Koke ensured Atletico would have no hangover from their efforts in dispatching Barca from the Champions League in midweek as he swept home the opener on 15 minutes before teeing up Torres to dink home just before the hour mark.Substitute Angel Correa rounded off the scoring with a cool finish seven minutes from time.",4/18/2016,Messi nets 500th goal but Barcelona ,sports

"BANGALORE: Virat Kohli�s 48-ball 79 powered Royal Challengers Bangalore to 191 for 5, and AB de Villiers and Shane Watson chipped in with 55 and 33. But their efforts were put to shade by Quinton de Kock, who made a bruising 51-ball 108, the first hundred in IPL 2016, to power Delhi Daredevils to a seven-wicket win at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.While De Kock starred in the lead role, Karun Nair, who hails from Bangalore, played the supporting role in 134-run third-wicket stand that came off 76 balls.Kohli showed he can be equally dangerous when setting targets. The groundwork was laid during the course of his second-wicket stand of 107 with de Villiers before Daredevils hit back with a tremendous exhibition of late-overs bowling courtesy the returning Mohammed Shami and Chris Morris, who conceded only 27 off the last four overs.Daredevils were dealt an early blow when Shreyas Iyer was dismissed by Shane Watson but it had little effect on de Kock as he pierced a packed off-side field for three fours off the offspinner Parvez Rasool in the second over.De Kock was particularly punishing through the off side, a majority of his runs coming behind square. Once he was set, the other elements to his game surfaced. A nonchalant flick off Harshal Patel in the ninth over soared over deep square leg, and once he was into the 90s he used the pace to scoop the ball over short fine leg. The end result was a wagon wheel with spokes all around the wicket.De Kock's sparkling form helped Daredevils ride a trough when Sanju Samson struggled to play his shots, but his dismissal in the sixth over turned their fortunes. Nair and de Kock got stuck in against Yuzvendra Chahal, Harshal Patel and David Wiese, whose combined tally at one point was 78 conceded off seven overs. Their predictability put immense pressure on Watson to deliver with the ball as the equation came down to 56 off the last six overs.De Kock brought up his century off his 48th ball. Once into the home stretch, there was a sense of inevitability to the game. After De Kock walked off to a round of applause from Watson, who had him caught behind, Duminy struck the winning runs, Chahal fielding his straight punch but giving away an overthrow with an underarm flick to try and catch Nair out of his crease.������������������������������������������������������",4/18/2016,Delhi beat Bangalore in high scoring IPL encounter,sports
"strong>MELBOURNE: South Africa are reluctant to play a day-night test during their tour of Australia as they have no experience with the pink ball, the Proteas� players association chief has said.</strongSouth Africa will tour Australia in a three-test series in the home summer and Cricket Australia announced last year that they wanted one of the fixtures to be a day-night match.Australia hosted New Zealand in the first day-night test in November and while the match drew huge crowds and big television audiences players on both sides complained that the ball was hard to see at times.The pink ball has been developed for day-night test cricket, replacing the traditional red ball which becomes too difficult for batsmen to see after dark.""Our players are not in favour of playing the game under those conditions,"" South African players� association Chief Executive Tony Irish told The Australian newspaper.""The main reason is we feel disadvantaged. Not one of our players who will compete in that test has played test match cricket, or any cricket, with a pink ball.""The reluctance to play is a sign of how much importance the South African players place on the series against Australia,"" Irish added.New Zealand players had similar misgivings about last year�s fixture in Adelaide but were given a A$1 million ($777,000) sweetener by Cricket Australia to commit.Organisers hailed the test a success, despite Australia wrapping up victory in three days.Adelaide tests are traditionally well supported by local fans and interstate visitors but the total attendance of 123,000 was a record in the city for a non-Ashes fixture.Australia, who have also used the pink ball in domestic Sheffield Shield matches, host Pakistan in a three-test series in the coming home summer, with a match at Brisbane�s Gabba ground tipped to be played under lights.Cricket Australia will announce their summer schedule on Wednesday and declined to comment on South Africa�s reservations about the pink ball.",4/19/2016,South Africa players against day night ,sports

"HYDERABAD: David Warner�s unbeaten 59-ball 90 steered Sunrisers Hyderabad to their first win of the season after their bowlers had kept Mumbai Indians to 142 in conditions that led to a well-matched contest between bat and ball.Southee kept Mumbai in the game with three well-timed wickets, starting with a late-swinging yorker to Shikhar Dhawan, but Mumbai kept feeding Warner a steady supply of release balls, which he put away merrily.He ended the game with two sixes in three balls, flat-batting Mitchell McClenaghan over mid-off and pulling him over deep square leg, and Sunrisers were home with 15 balls remaining. Mumbai's defeat was their third in four matches.It only took four balls for Bhuvneshwar Kumar to strike, though it was swing rather than seam that did the damage. With Kieron Pollard out due to food poisoning, Mumbai had brought in Martin Guptill, and his debut innings in the IPL was terminated by a perfectly pitched outswinger that kissed his edge through to the wicketkeeper.Parthiv Patel looked distinctly uncomfortable against the swinging ball, playing and missing repeatedly before he was bowled by a back-of-the-hand slower ball from Barinder Sran that jagged in like a left-arm wristspinner's googly. Then came a self-inflicted wound - Rohit, who came in at No. 4, running himself out while looking for a suicidal single. When Jos Buttler, surprised by extra pace from Sran, gloved an attempted pull in the 11th over, they were 60 for 4 and going nowhere.At the crease now were Ambati Rayudu, who had been promoted to No. 3, and Krunal Pandya, who had been promoted to No. 6 ahead of his brother Hardik, who had batted at No. 3 in all of Mumbai's previous matches. All the meddling with the batting order indicated a muddled think-tank, but Rayudu and Krunal made the most of their opportunities.Moises Henriques and the left-arm spinner Bipul Sharma varied their pace cleverly in the middle overs.

"MOHALI: Kolkata Knight Riders thrashed Kings XI Punjab by six wickets here on Sunday to go on top of the table in the Indian Premier League 2016.Knight Riders' bowling depth was perceptible as their spinners ripped through Kings XI, in a sub-par batting performance, to keep them to 138 for 8.In the chase, Robin Uthappa's quickfire fifty effectively sealed the game. In 13 games this season, 12 have been won by the chasing team.Put in to bat, Kings XI lost Manan Vohra early when he flicked Morne Morkel to deep square leg but M Vijay looked in rhythm, scything drives and cuts before failing to pick a googly from Piyush Chawla.The stage was set for either of David Miller or Glenn Maxwell to fire their side back into the contest, but Knight Riders' experienced bowling attack strangled their strong middle order.With two left-handers batting - Marsh and Miller - Gautam Gambhir turned to Yusuf Pathan for the first time this season. The move reaped rewards instantly when Miller edged Yusuf's first ball and Uthappa took a sharp catch.Maxwell soon resorted to a switch-hit off Sunil Narine, but Kings XI's season was summed up when he hammered it to extra cover. Narine's remodeled action returned two wickets in a frugal spell with an economy rate of 5.50.In a format where teams target implausible numbers during the second half of an innings, Knight Riders' spinners ensured Kings XI could only rebuild after leaving them at 94 for 5 in the 15th over.In between, Marsh used swift footwork to accumulate runs and was particularly effective square of the wicket, on both sides. He got to his fifty in the last over with a sweetly-timed lofted drive over long-on. Along with Kyle Abbott, he took Andre Russell's first over - the last of the innings - for 18 to lift Kings XI to 138.Kings XI needed a miraculous start but Uthappa and Gambhir pushed Knight Riders closer to the target with nine boundaries in a 65-run Powerplay, the most productive in this season.The seamers, Sandeep Sharma and Abbott, were inconsistent but when they found their lengths, Uthappa cleared the infield with lofted strokes on the up, on a pitch offering even bounce and carry.Uthappa eased himself to his first fifty of the season off just 24 balls but his premeditated sweep resulted in his dismissal, as he played around a full delivery from Pardeep Sahu. Gambhir looked set for another fifty before a leading edge was acrobatically taken by Glenn Maxwell, running in from deep midwicket.Axar Patel removed Manish Pandey and Shakib Al Hasan, but Suryakumar Yadav and Yusuf took Knight Riders home with 17 balls to spare.",4/20/2016,Kolkata thrash Punjab to go on top in IPL,sports

Jos Buttler and Kieron Pollard, returning from food poisoning, flexed their muscles by hitting five sixes between them, and Mumbai recorded their second win in five matches.Mumbai, who opted to bowl, were staring at a 200-plus target as Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers feasted on some friendly bowling during the course of a 59-run stand, before the unheralded players, in what was billed as a battle of two heavyweight teams, rose to the occasion.Krunal Pandya�s twin strikes to get rid of Kohli and de Villiers in the space of five deliveries stunned Royal Challengers. Shane Watson fell not long after, but then Travis Head, on IPL debut, and Sarfaraz Khan lifted Royal Challengers from 99 for 4 to 170 for 7.KL Rahul was put through a short-ball test in a hostile burst by Mitchell McClenaghan, during which he was hit hard on the helmet. After the early jitters, though, he ramped and slapped his way to 23 before being caught in the slips. Kohli and de Villiers then counterpunched before the cluster of wickets resulted in a complete breakdown in momentum.Head took his time to settle in before exhibiting his ball-striking power to swat Hardik Pandya for six over deep square leg in the 15th over. Sarfaraz showed there is more to his game than just scoops and paddles as he milked the spinners before clubbing Jasprit Bumrah for two successive sixes in the final over.Mumbai lost Parthiv Patel in the second over of the chase, but Varun Aaron's third over, which went for 19, brought their innings back on track. Once Royal Challengers' uncapped Indian bowlers were summoned, a game that was only marginally tilted in Mumbai's favour turned decisively in their direction.

With Pakistan, it is more trying to get the routine right but it is also about the preparation off the field regarding fitness, Flower told ESPNCricinfo.�You not only need that in fielding and bowling but equally in batting.<br/> If you are physically fit it will definitely lead to a good life style and better judgement at the crease he said.Flower said, �our players are very inconsistent with the way they practice. They do work on their weak areas but they could do a lot more. When you are an international player you should be waking up and asking yourself what I have to do more to improve myself. If you are not answering that question then I don�t think you should be there�, he said.Flower said that the upcoming camp for the national team ahead of their tour of England will also have a session with a psychologist.He said he hopes that the upcoming camp will also cover the psychologist session and the players take that in a positive manner.Flower said it requires a lot of sacrifice to play for the country.�A good student of the game learns everyday life style gym work and all those things required to be a better cricketer�, he said.He claimed that it is not like 20 minutes in the gym and 20 minutes in the nets.<br/> �It is about quality time absorbing everything rather than just being seen doing the right stuff and walking away saying that I have done enough.

We got him out soon afterwards but it ruined my day.�Hawkins technology works much like the real�time Snicko meter with the bat sensor picking up vibrations in the bat and making the results readily available on the smart phones to be worn by the on-field umpires.�We experimented in the nets and found that even the finest edge a feather that the bowler didn�t hear is detected,� Hawkins said.�",4/22/2016,New technology to detect edges in cricket to be launched ,sports

West Indies retained their eighth-place ranking but lead Bangladesh by only eight points.South Africa and West Indies lost the most points in the update, 17 and 11 respectively. The calculation process dropped results from 2012-13, while outcomes from 2014-15 were weighted at 50%. Only the latest results had 100% weightage. As a result, South Africa's series victories over England, Australia, New Zealand and Pakistan in 2012-13 were not factored in.

West Indies had beaten New Zealand, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe in 2012-13 but lost to Australia and Sri Lanka in 2015-16.The update favoured Pakistan, because their 2-0 loss to Sri Lanka in August 2014 was weighted at 50%.

"MELBOURNE: Australia�s cricket board will make it compulsory for players to wear helmets when facing fast and medium-paced bowling in line with recommendations from a review into the death of Test batsman Phillip Hughes.Wicketkeepers and players fielding close to the wicket will also have to wear helmets in first class matches in accordance with the David Curtain review, which was released on Wednesday.The helmets, mandatory in games and during practice, must adhere to the highest British standard, Cricket Australia (CA) said.Hughes was struck on the back of the head by a rising delivery when batting for South Australia in a domestic match in November 2014.He died two days later in a Sydney hospital aged 25.""There�s not a day that goes by where we don�t think of Phillip,"" CA boss James Sutherland told reporters at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Wednesday.""This report won�t bring him back and it won�t do anything to ease the pain of his family or his loved ones who miss him most.""But we have a responsibility and a duty to ensure nothing like this ever happens again.""Hughes�s death shocked the cricketing world and ignited a debate about safety standards, particularly for batsmen, who face fast bowling that can exceed 150 kilometres per hour (93 mph).Hughes was wearing an Australian standard helmet when he was struck but the Curtain report said even the newer British standard helmet available at the time would not have afforded him extra protection from the blow.The report also said an apparent delay in the arrival of the ambulance team that treated Hughes played no part in his death.""I am of the opinion the attention received by Phillip after being struck had no role whatsoever on his subsequent demise, due to the nature and severity of his injury,"" it said.The report also recommended wicketkeepers play with protective eye-wear but stopped short of endorsing the clip-on neck guards on the back of helmets, which some players have worn after Hughes�s death.Sutherland said CA still encouraged players to wear the guards but conceded, like the report, that more research was required to determine whether they actually increased safety.""We�re certainly taking up the running on that to make sure we understand it better,"" he said.Sutherland said the board had also sought approval from the International Cricket Council to trial the use of injury substitutes who could bat and bowl in domestic games.Substitutes have been permitted to replace injured or ill players in matches for over 100 years but are not allowed to bat, bowl or act as wicketkeepers or captains, according to the laws of the game.Initially the substitutes would replace players ruled out by concussion but in future their use could be expanded to include other forms of injury, Sutherland added.",5/11/2016,Australia toughens helmet standards after Hughes revi,sports

"strong>MEXICO CITY: FIFA unveiled the timetable of its delayed bidding process for the 2026 World Cup on Tuesday, with president Gianni Infantino's plans for a 40-team tournament to be decided upon by October and a final decision on the hosts to be made in May 2020.</strongFootball's world governing body said it would consider giving the green light to joint bids and review a rule which currently allows a continent to stage the tournament every eight years.A FIFA source said they had considered increasing this wait period to 12 years or more and that there had been no discussions about allowing a continent to host successive World Cups.This could mean that with Russia hosting the 2018 World Cup, Europe would have to wait until at least 2030 before staging the tournament again.The decisions were among the first passed by the new-look FIFA Council, which was holding its maiden meeting since it replaced the old executive committee under reforms passed in February.The Council, which has a strategic role, ruled that bidding nations would have to meet requirements on human rights, sustainable event management and environmental protection. Bidders who did not meet ""technical requirements"" would be excluded, it said.Infantino was elected as FIFA president in February when one of his main promises was to increase the number of teams in the finals from 32 to 40, a proposal which is strongly opposed by Europe's biggest clubs.FIFA said that decisions were expected by October on the number of teams, the format for the tournament, the ""eligibility of (continental) confederations to bid"" and whether to allow joint bids.Joint bids were banned in 2011 but Infantino has said he wants to encourage them, possibly spreading the tournament around several countries in a region.strong>CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION</strongFIFA said that a ""consultation process"", outlining new standards for bidders, would run until May 2017, followed by a preparation phase running until December 2018 when countries would have to submit their bids.The bids would be evaluated from January 2019 to February 2020 with a final decision three months later.FIFA was forced to reform its bidding process after the vote in December 2010 awarded the 2018 and 2022 tournaments to Russia and Qatar respectively.That vote is the subject of a criminal investigation by Swiss authorities, while Qatar's preparations have also been marred by allegations of abuse of migrant workers in the construction industry. Qatar says it is working to solve the issue.Under revised statutes, the hosts will be chosen by the 209 members of FIFA at its annual Congress. The Council, however, will still draw up a shortlist of three candidates. Previously, hosting rights were decided by the old executive committee.FIFA said that Gibraltar and Kosovo's applications for membership would be submitted to the Congress on Friday and that both would be allowed to take part in the 2018 World Cup qualifying competition if accepted.Benin was suspended with immediate effect due to legal interference in the country's football federation. A decision not to suspend Greece was ratified by the Council.FIFA Council member Fernando Sarney praised Infantino's leadership on Tuesday.""Things are getting calmer in FIFA,"" the Brazilian representative told reporters.""Gianni is talking about football, he is travelling around, talking to people and trying to put football back into our conversations because before we talked about everything apart from football.""",5/11/2016,FIFA unveil 2026 World Cup bidding pr,sports

"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's newly appointed coach Mickey Arthur feels that dearth of international cricket at home has damaged Pakistan cricket and termed it as one of the reasons behind Pakistan�s decline in the game.The former Australia and South Africa coach said that Pakistani batsmen will have to play an important role to achieve results for the team.�Pakistan is playing all the cricket outside the country. Every time they play it is an away series which is really hard. It is always difficult playing outside your condition and it has dented Pakistan cricket�, in an exclusive interview with a private news channel Arthur said.The South African-born coach said that he picked up the role of coaching Pakistan team considering it as a big challenge and that he was looking forward to deliver results but demanded consistency in team decisions for any positive outcome.�I think it�s a great challenge. Pakistan cricket has struggled a little bit in the last couple of years and certainly I am keen to bring it back to its rightful place in the ranking and the rightful place in world cricket�, he said.Talking about his first assignment with Pakistan team, the tour of England, Arthur said that the series will be a big challenge for the players and key will be to learn how to perform outside the United Arab Emirates, where Pakistan has been playing most of its cricket recently.�Pakistan has got a wonderful group of bowlers. We need to work on batting, particularly outside the UAE, and that will be key. Also we need to bring the fielding up to standards of international level,� he added.�It will be a challenge for players that how they are going to handle the conditions outside the UAE and Pakistan. You need your batsmen to step up and score runs.<br/> So technically we need to work really hard to get our batting 100 percent right�, said 47-year-old former cricketer.During Arthur�s coaching stint, South Africa reached the top in all the three formats.Arthur said he is confident that Pakistan can also achieve the top position but warned that it can be achieved only if there is consistency in team decisions.<br/> �You need opportunity and time to build the team in order to achieve the result.<br/> We need to be consistent with our selections, we need to be consistent with our players and we need to allow players to express themselves without any consequences.�That�s the key, players need to find out how they go about and play in certain situations. I hope we can give the players that experience and make sure they go forward�, he said.Arthur said he did not feel any language barrier while working with Pakistani players during the Pakistan Super League earlier this year, where he coached the team Karachi Kings but added that he would still look to have a local coach as his assistant so that his message is not lost in translation.�I will have a local coach as my assistant who can deliver my message to the guys.<br/> That is quite important. But language barrier wasn�t a problem in PSL and I hope it won�t be a problem while coaching Pakistan as well�, he said.Sharing his PSL experience Arthur said that his experience of working with Pakistani players was excellent as they pose immense talent.�I was very impressed with the talent in the PSL.

"strong>MEXICO CITY: A few steps from the entrance to Mexico City's imposing Presidente Hotel, where FIFA delegates are staying during this week's Congrees, a boy of around 10-years-old sells tamarind balls covered in chili powder from a cart for 10 Mexican pesos ($0.55) each.</strongThe spicy, tangy sweets are a local specialty yet are unlikely to have been tasted by the FIFA delegates. The guests of world soccer are more likely to be inside sipping lattes for eight times the price.FIFA has often been known for lavishing a five-star lifestyle on its delegates and officials. When former president Sepp Blatter went to an event in Zurich with the city's mayor, he arrived in a chauffeur-driven limousine while the politician came and went by tram.But after Gianni Infantino was elected president of soccer's scandal-plagued body in February, one of his first pledges was to make FIFA more humble, suggesting, among other things, that federation officials no longer wore suits to matches.The early signs were promising as he flew to Britain for his first official engagement by a budget airline rather than the private plane favoured by his predecessor.But this week's Congress in Mexico City has looked as extravagant as any held under Blatter.FIFA confirmed that it paid all the expenses for each of its 209 member associations to bring a three-man delegation, flying business class and staying in five-star accommodation. Each delegate was also given $1,000 in spending money.LEAVE THE BUBBLERooms at the Presidente are booked for about $400 a night. Members of the FIFA Council, the world governing body's board, are staying at the plusher Four Seasons hotel where rooms typically cost $675 a night, according to hotel booking websites.FIFA sources told Reuters that efforts were being made to persuade delegates to leave their bubble but having them walk a few hundred yards took some effort.Some were seen walking the 500 metres from their hotel to Thursday's opening ceremony at the city's 10,000-seat National Auditorium, considered one of the world's best entertainment venues.It was seen by FIFA as a step, albeit it a small one, in the right direction, although others insisted on taking a luxury bus.The night before, FIFA seemed as detached as ever when their so-called Legends team of former international footballers took part in an exhibition match at Mexico City's historic Azteca stadium.FIFA billed it as a ""football fiesta"" and said it was ""engaging more with the football world and getting football back to the heart of FIFA,� It was closed to the public.It was witnessed only by specially invited guests who spent most of the evening in a tent built onto the pitch, where they were pampered with wine, champagne and canapes, while traditional Mexican dances were performed on a stage.Privately, FIFA sources said the event had been hastily arranged and had not been what they intended.Infantino, who has vowed to cut costs, was somewhat vague when asked about it at a media conference on Friday, though he said it was something FIFA could look into.""I think it's always been the case that they are paid $1,000 as a fee for the delegates, it's part of the budget approved by the finance committee,"" he said.""It's good that it's been raised and we might have a look at it.""",5/14/2016,FIFA five star lifestyle Mexico City,sports

"DUBAI: The ICC has opened discussions with broadcasters about organising World Twenty20 tournaments in 2018 and 2022, thus the event will be played every two years.This means two extra World Cups will be added to the existing schedule as it looks to cash in on the booming popularity of the game�s shortest format.After the success of the World Twenty20 in India recently, the ICC does not want to wait another four years for the next tournament, which is due to be staged in Australia in 2020.This was proposed at the ICC recent board meeting in Dubai about holding a World Twenty20 every two years with West Indies a possibility for the proposed 2018 tournament and the UAE in 2022. The proposal is expected to be added to the agenda for the ICC�s annual general meeting in Edinburgh at the end of June for formal discussion.An informal sounding out of broadcasters has begun about adding the tournaments to the recent $2?billion (�1.4?billion) rights deal signed with Star Sports in 2014 that runs until 2023. That deal included a World Twenty20 this year and in 2020 after the ICC decided to place its three global tournaments (the World Cup, Champions Trophy and World Twenty20) on a four year cycle.But the collapse of the Twenty20 Champions League, which featured domestic teams from around the world, has left a hole in the calendar in September-October, a time which is suitable for cricket in seven of the nine Test playing nations.Sources have confirmed the ICC has explored the possibility of holding the men�s World Twenty20 in the West Indies in 2018, possibly as a run in or at the same as the women�s version is due to take place in the Caribbean. But the problem with the Caribbean is the time difference makes it incompatible with the Indian market, where the vast broadcast deals are on offer.Another possibility is South Africa, although the government there recently banned its cricket board from hosting global tournament because it had failed to meet racial quotas. The UAE has the infrastructure to host the tournament and the time difference works well with India. England is a non starter because this country is already hosting the 2017 Champions Trophy and 2019 World Cup.The recent World Twenty20 was hailed by the ICC for bringing in record television ratings. The group match between Pakistan and India was watched by 83?million people and in this country the pulsating final between England and West Indies brought Sky Sports a peak of 2.45?million viewers, the channel�s highest rating for a cricket match.Tweets about the World Twenty20 received 5.75?billion impressions and the ICC claimed 46?million people engaged with the tournament on Facebook. �It is a fact that the ICC World Twenty20 2016 engaged with fans, old and new, like never before,� said Dave Richardson, the ICC�s chief executive.�",5/15/2016,ICC opens talks with broadcasters to hold two extra World T20,sports

"LEEDS: A diligent half-century from Alex Hales, coupled with some home-ground know-how from Jonny Bairstow, helped England to regroup with a 88-run stand for the sixth wicket on the first day of the first Test against Sri Lanka, after their ambitions had been dramatically dented by the loss of five wickets for 34 runs either side of the lunch break.By tea, Hales was unbeaten on 71, his second Test half-century in nine innings and his highest yet, beating the 60 he made against South Africa at Cape Town in January.At the other end was Bairstow, who arrived at the crease with England's innings in crisis at 83 for 5, but responded with the sort of sparky counter-punching. Bairstow's 54 not out from 67 balls took the attack back to Sri Lanka, who nevertheless remained firmly in the contest at 171 for 5, thanks to Dasun Shanaka's sensational debut breakthroughs.After being put into bat on a morning when bowling first was a no-brainer for both captains, England's openers were obliged to rein in the extravagant strokeplay that has coloured so much of their cricket in recent months - a situation that might have been tailor-made for Alastair Cook. He began the match needing another 36 runs to reach 10,000 Test runs, and after getting off the mark with a sixth-ball clip for four through midwicket, appeared well set for the long grind until Shanaka's introduction, in the 18th over of the day, tore up the pre-conceived script.Shanaka launched his Test career with a maiden before striking with the first ball of his second over. Cook had been leaving the ball with his usual sangfroid for most of his 52 deliveries, but having creamed one cover drive off Nuwan Pradeep, he was drawn into another from the slower, wobblier Shanaka. The full length outside off left him a touch, and Cook scuffed an edge through to Dinesh Chandimal, the keeper. He was gone for 16, and still needs another 20 runs to notch up a landmark that has been on his conscience since the start of the South Africa tour in December.Three balls later, however, such thoughts had been whisked out of England's minds. Nick Compton - whose anxieties cannot have been aided by his team-mates' struggles to impose themselves - poked with caution at a perfect off-stump line and length, to squeeze a low edge through to Lahiru Thirimanne at first slip. He was gone for a duck as Shanaka became only the third bowler in Test history, and the first since Richard Johnson in 2003, to claim two wickets before conceding his first career run.And, as if that was not enough of an impact on debut, Shanaka then added England's main man to his tally, as Joe Root - in such golden touch in all formats - was also drawn into a drive that scudded to Kusal Mendis at third slip.It was a dream start for Shanaka, who had been awarded his Test cap by Mahela Jayawardene before the start of play, and a timely boost for a beleaguered Sri Lanka squad too, who began the match knowing that Dhammika Prasad, their matchwinning seamer on this ground two years ago, will miss the whole Test series after flying home to resolve a shoulder injury.By tea, however, Hales and Bairstow had provided their team with a steadying hand, as a forecast rain shower swept in from the Pennines to delay the resumption of play.",5/19/2016,Hales Bairstow rescue England with 88 run unbeaten stand,sports
"LEEDS: Alastair Cook�s bid to become the first England batsman to reach 10,000 Test runs had been relegated to an afterthought by lunch on the first morning of the first Test at Headingley, as the Sri Lanka debutant Dasun Shanaka claimed three wickets for one run in the space of eight balls to cut a swathe through England's much-heralded top order.By lunch, Cook had been dismissed for 16 - still 20 runs shy of his landmark - with Nick Compton and Joe Root, the local hero and newly-crowned England Test player of the year, both following for ducks in a sensational ten-minute spell before lunch.It was left to Alex Hales, who had been growing in confidence on 38 after an anxious first hour, and England's own debutant, James Vince, to glue the innings together. Vince had yet to get off the mark after 15 balls of watchful defence, as England settled for a lunchtime scoreline - and a definite bout of indigestion - of 57 for 3.Shanaka had been brought on to bowl the 19th over of the innings with England apparently looking solid on 44 for 0 after Cook and Hales had seen off the new-ball danger of Shaminda Eranga and Nuwan Pradeep.Instead, having launched his Test career with a maiden, Shanaka struck with his seventh delivery to tempt Cook with a fuller length outside off, and scuffed an edge through to Dinesh Chandimal, the keeper.Then, three balls later, Compton poked with caution at a perfect off-stump line and length, to squeeze a low edge through to Lahiru Thirimanne at first slip.Shanaka then added England's main man to his tally, as Root - in such golden touch in all formats - was also drawn into a drive as Shanaka's wobbly medium-pace left his shot just a fraction and scudded to Kusal Mendis at third slip instead.It was a dream start for Shanaka and a timely boost for a beleaguered Sri Lanka squad too, who began the match knowing that Dhammika Prasad, their matchwinning seamer on this ground two years ago, will miss the whole Test series after flying home to resolve a shoulder injury.The second hour of the session also featured a lively but unsuccessful introduction for Sri Lanka's pacy young quick bowler, Dushmantha Chameera, as well as a typically accurate probe from the spinner, Rangana Herath, whose solitary over was blocked out for a maiden by Hales before the break.Both sides are wearing black armbands in recognition of the floods that are currently affecting Sri Lanka.�",5/19/2016,Sri Lankas Shanaka debut triple stings England,sports

"A Chinese magnate has agreed to buy historic English football club Aston Villa, the latest in a series of investments from China into football worldwide as President Xi Jinping looks to make the country a global powerhouse in the sport.The deal, reportedly worth 60 million pounds ($88 million), will see the chairman of little-known Recon Group, Xia Jiantong, become the first mainland Chinese to fully own an English team.Under the leadership of Xi, an avid fan, China has made it a goal to one day win the World Cup, and has ploughed huge amounts of investment into grassroots academies, television rights, transfer deals for overseas players and investment in clubs abroad.More broadly, Beijing is aiming to grow the domestic sports market to 5 trillion yuan ($782 billion) by 2025, about five times its current scale.China's biggest overseas investment in football so far occurred in December last year, when a consortium led by state-backed China Media Capital took a $400 million stake in the owner of Villa's far larger and wealthier rival, Manchester City.The Villa deal, however, with 100 percent ownership, is not just an investment.""The Chinese ownership now get to decide how to run the club,"" said Mark Dreyer, Beijing-based founder of sports information website China Sports Insider.Crosstown arch-rivals Birmingham City are also run from Asia, following the 2009 takeover by Hong Kong businessman Carson Yeung.Villa's American owner Randy Lerner, who put the club on the market in 2014, struck the deal after former English champions Villa suffered a miserable season that left them relegated from the country's top football league.Recon Group, Xia's privately owned holding company, owns a controlling interest in five publicly listed companies on the Hong Kong and Chinese stock exchanges.The deal with American-educated Xia, 39, ends an unhappy tenure for Lerner, who bought the midlands club for 62.2 million pounds in 2006. Fans have openly demonstrated against his continued involvement with Villa, who were European champions in 1982 and have won the English top-flight title seven times.The club ended the recent season bottom of the English Premier League table, with only half the number of points of the next worst team.""Aston Villa's relegation really played in their favour,"" said Fredrik van Huynh, Shanghai-based director of HHC Sports Group. ""It will have pushed down the price quite significantly.""Xia, who studied at Harvard University and has a doctorate, took to his official microblog late on Wednesday to wish the club's fans ""health and happiness"".Earlier this month he posted: ""Go, Villa, Go! We will be back.""The club said Xia's immediate objective was ""to return Aston Villa to the Premier League and then to have the club finish in the top six, bringing European football back to Villa Park"".It added the deal would also help make Villa the most famous football club in China.Dreyer at China Sports Insider dismissed that as ""simply ludicrous"", given the appeal of much bigger rivals such as Spain's Barcelona and England's Manchester United and Arsenal.""I think fans of the club will remain sceptical until it becomes clear what his true motivations are,"" he added.($1 = 0.6837 pounds)",5/19/2016,Chinese magnate to buy English soccer team Aston Vi,sports
"Sevilla conjured up a dazzling comeback to clinch a record third successive Europa League title on Wednesday, flooring Liverpool with a 3-1 victory that showed why the Spanish side have become masters of Europe's second-tier competition.Sevilla captain Coke lifted the trophy at Basel's St Jakob-Park having been the architect of their heroics, scoring twice to leave Liverpool gasping on the canvas after Kevin Gameiro had cancelled out Daniel Sturridge's opener.It was a remarkable turnaround after Liverpool had dominated the first half so completely that Juergen Klopp's side should have been home and dry, but they failed to inflict further damage when their opponents were reeling.Unai Emery's team hit back with three goals in 25 minutes, the first coming just 17 seconds after the interval, to claim the trophy for the fifth time in 11 seasons and become the first side in 40 years to win three consecutive European competitions.""At Sevilla we love this competition and we love it so much and we want it so much that we won it,"" Emery said. ""It is our competition and we underlined that once again.""For Liverpool and Klopp, who has now suffered successive final defeats in his seven months in charge after February's League Cup disappointment, it was a dispiriting occasion.His team's hopes of Champions League qualification were dashed, leaving Liverpool to face up to a season with no European competition.""The players are still young,"" Klopp told reporters. ""We will use this experience today and someday everyone will say Basel was a decisive moment for Liverpool FC.""It had looked, however, like being an entirely different outcome at the interval.The opening goal arrived after 35 minutes and was a genuine moment of class from Sturridge, who received the ball on the left edge of the area before expertly picking his spot with a pin-point curling finish off the outside of his left boot.The England striker had already had a header hacked off the line and Liverpool had two vociferous penalty appeals for handball waved away by referee Jonas Eriksson as they turned the screw on their opponents.The halftime whistle came to Sevilla's rescue, however, allowing them to regroup before clawing themselves off the ropes with an immediate sucker punch.Seconds had elapsed before Liverpool left back Alberto Moreno, whose mistakes have cost his side on a number of occasions this season, darted hopelessly into a tackle on Mariano Ferreira, who skipped past him and crossed for Gameiro to side-foot into an empty net.Then it was Liverpool's turn to hit the panic button as Gameiro wasted two further chances before Coke added a second after 63 minutes.Vitolo danced through a series of Liverpool tackles before the ball landed invitingly for the Sevilla skipper to curl his finish into the corner.The final nail in Liverpool's coffin sparked fury on the touchline as Coke kept his cool to bury his second goal beneath Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet, only for the linesman to briefly raise his flag before putting it down again.After some pushing and shoving the goal stood, leaving Liverpool with a mountain to climb.Having retreated so far into their shell, however, they were incapable of rising above base camp.",5/19/2016,Canny Sevilla retain iron grip on Europa League trophy,sports
"LEEDS: The England pace attack ripped out Sri Lanka for 91 after Jonny Bairstow made an excellent century to put the hosts in complete control of the first Test on the second day in Leeds on Friday.Bairstow�s superb knock of 140 lifted England to 298 in their first innings before James Anderson and Stuart Broad took nine wickets between them in favourable conditions for seam bowling at Headingley.England captain Alastair Cook enforced the follow-on and the touring side negotiated two deliveries to reach one for no wicket before bad light ended play. Sri Lanka trail by 206 runs in the opening match of the three-Test series.England had resumed in the morning on 171 for five and Bairstow and Alex Hales extended their sixth-wicket partnership to 141. Hales, on 86, was in sight of his maiden test century when he skied spinner Rangana Herath to deep extra cover.Moeen Ali (nought) and Broad (two) were dismissed by Dushmantha Chameera in the same over but Bairstow, dropped on 70, completed his second Test hundred and celebrated the achievement enthusiastically on his home ground.Bairstow found a solid partner in Steven Finn, the pair adding 56 for the ninth wicket before the former skied a catch to mid-on off Chameera.Sri Lanka made a dreadful start to their reply as experienced fast bowlers Anderson and Broad exploited the conditions superbly.Dimuth Karunaratne, Kaushal Silva and Kusal Mendis all edged catches to wicketkeeper Bairstow, leaving the tourists in deep trouble at 12 for three.Dinesh Chandimal, on 15, was well held by James Vince at third slip off Ben Stokes before Anderson trapped captain Angelo Mathews lbw for 34 and then dismissed Dasun Shanaka first ball that the batsman nicked to Bairstow.Herath was smartly caught by Stokes in the slips off Anderson for one, Chameera (2) drove Broad to Finn at mid-off and Lahiru Thirimanne, on 22, was caught by Finn at mid-on off Broad.Anderson completed his 19th five-wicket haul in Tests and outstanding figures of five for 16 when he had Shaminda Eranga caught by Bairstow down the leg-side.�",5/20/2016,Sri Lanka skittled out for 91 in reply to Englands 298,sports
"LEEDS: England took command on the second afternoon of the first Test at Headingley after Jonny Bairstow played �a brilliant counter-punching innings of 140 and later added three catches behind the stumps. With a total of 298 to defend, Stuart Broad and James Anderson produced another classy display of seam and swing bowling to leave the Sri Lankans rattled on 43 for 3 at tea.It was a situation far removed from the 83-for-5 scoreline that had confronted Bairstow when he walked out to bat shortly after lunch on the first day. And with the new ball jagging alarmingly from a full length as Broad and Anderson brought all of their huge experience to bear, it took a gutsy response from Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal, Sri Lanka's most experienced pairing, to reach the break without further damage.Faced with grey skies and a packed cordon, Sri Lanka's openers, Dimuth Karunaratne and Kaushal Silva betrayed their anxieties in the very first over, when they hesitated so long over a quick single that they could have ended up shaking hands in the middle of the pitch.Instead, they simply waved goodbye in the space of five deliveries as, first, Broad straightened one off the seam to kiss the edge of the left-handed Karunaratne, who departed for a 12-ball duck, before Anderson drew level with Kapil Dev on 434 career wickets by finding some extra lift to dispose of Silva for 11.One over later, and Broad had two wickets in three balls as he went wide on the crease to spear an angled full-length ball into Kusal Mendis' forward defence, for Bairstow to snaffle the slenderest of deflections behind the stumps.Chandimal and Mathews, however, stood firm in a 31-run stand before the interval.The story of the day, however, remained Bairstow's happy homecoming - a second Test century and his first at his Yorkshire home. Continuing the theme that Bairstow and his fellow not-out batsman, Alex Hales, had established on the first afternoon, England's sixth-wicket pair extended their stand to 141 to banish the memories of the top-order wobble, when five wickets had tumbled for 34 runs.At the other end, Hales wound his neck in and banished all risk from his game as he set his sights on the remaining 29 runs he needed for his maiden Test century. But he faced with a change of tempo as Rangana Herath came into the attack, Hales' patience snapped for good. In Herath's second over, he skipped down the track and failed to reach the pitch of the ball with an ambitious wallop over the covers. A fast flat leading edge fizzed out to Dushmantha Chameera at deep extra cover, who pouched the offering with a well-judged dive.If Hales' failing had been to linger too long, then a different criticism could be levelled at Moeen Ali. England's No. 8 had admitted before the match that he had lost a bit of confidence in being slated to come in so low for his country, but the hasty manner in which he came and went didn't exactly enhance his case for a promotion. He had failed to score from his first seven deliveries when he drove too firmly at his eighth, from Chameera, and lobbed a simple catch off the inside edge and pad, to Mendis under the helmet at short leg.It was a timely reward for the slippery Chameera, bowling only his second over of the day. He had erred on the short side in his fruitless first day's work, but was soon celebrating two wickets in the space of five deliveries when Broad drove flat-footedly at a hint of width outside off and spread-eagled his own stumps via an inside edge.Bairstow simply stared down the track, rather nonplussed by the clatter of wickets in his midst. But he didn't have to wait long to reframe the story of the session. From the first ball of Chameera's next over, Bairstow drilled a drive into the covers, paused as a wild shy came in at the non-striker's end, then galloped through with glee as the ball zipped through for overthrows to gift him his second century and his first on home soil.",5/20/2016,England strike against Sri Lanka after Bairstow century,sports
"LEEDS: Jonny Bairstow brought up his second Test century, and his first on his home ground at Headingley, as England continued their fightback on the second morning of the first Test against Sri Lanka. However, with Alex Hales falling short in his own quest for three figures, Sri Lanka battled back with three wickets in the second hour of the session, and will be armed with a brand-new ball when play resumes after lunch.Continuing the theme that Hales and Bairstow had established on the first afternoon, the pair extended their sixth-wicket stand to 141 to banish the memories of England's top-order wobble, when five wickets had tumbled for 34 runs. Bairstow was once again the aggressor, as befits a man in supreme form on his Yorkshire home ground - his last two innings at the venue have been 246 and 198.Bairstow outscored his partner by three to one throughout their morning resumption, capitalising on too much width as both Sri Lanka openers, Shaminda Eranga and Nuwan Pradeep, offered opportunities to fillet the third-man boundary. He did enjoy one clear moment of good fortune however, on 70, when Pradeep failed to gather a sharp return catch to his right, as Bairstow scuffed a drive back down the track.At the other end, Hales wound his neck in and banished all risk from his game as he set his sights on the remaining 29 runs he needed for his maiden Test century. It was a grind, as he routinely refused to chase anything outside his eyeline, except for one clear opportunity on 82, when Dimuth Karunaratne failed to cling onto a flying edge at slip off the bowling off Angelo Mathews.It could have been the slice of luck that Hales needed. But four runs later, and faced with a change of tempo as Rangana Herath came into the attack, Hales' patience snapped for good. In Herath's second over, he skipped down the track and failed to reach the pitch of the ball with an ambitious wallop over the covers. A fast flat leading edge fizzed out to Dushmantha Chameera at deep extra cover, who pouched the offering with a well-judged dive.Hales was visibly distraught, lingering at the crease for several seconds and looking as though he wanted to snap his errant bat in two. Though he belatedly acknowledged the crowd as he dragged himself from the field, he knew that he had thrown away a priceless opportunity to silence those who doubt his credentials as a Test match opener.It could have set his summer up at the first opportunity. Instead, having added 15 runs to his overnight 71 in 52 deliveries, with a dropped catch thrown in the mix as well, he will know that the jury remains out. At least, for those of a superstitious bent, he had guaranteed his fate would be different to the last two England openers to make a maiden Test hundred at Headingley - both Sam Robson (2014) and Adam Lyth (2015) were out of the side by the end of the summer.If Hales' failing had been to linger too long, then a different criticism could be levelled at Moeen Ali.

"ISLAMABAD: �England and Wales Cricket Board (EWCB) director Andrew Strauss has announced that a points system crossing all formats will be used for the matches against Sri Lanka and Pakistan this summer.The Super Series will get underway when the international summer begins with the first Test between England and Sri Lanka at Headingley on Thursday.As is traditional individual series trophies will still be atstake for the Tests one�day internationals and one�off Twenty20internationals against both tourists.But a system will also be introduced whereby the sides can earn four points for a Test win, two for a draw and two for a victory in one of the white�ball matches www.skysports.com reported.An overall win may therefore possibly not be achieved until the final match in each series which will be the Twenty20 matches in the case of this summer�s tours and an unsponsored prize of 25,000 will be put up by the home board. The idea is Strauss own and he outlined the thinking behind it at Headingley on Wednesday.�Today I�m introducing the Super Series the winner of which will be the overall tour winner for the Sri Lanka and Pakistan series over all formats�, �said the former England captain.�The rationale is that the game of cricket is evolving unbelievably quickly and I think we feel responsibility to ensure the international game develops. Central to that is context and relevance for every game of cricket you play. We believe the Super Series will provide that by connecting the formats and ensuring every game counts for something more than just itself.�Two separate white�ball teams and a red�ball team will be connected by something greater than their own immediate interests. What this doesn�t do is replace any of the individual series awards this summer so there will still be a Test series victory plus the one-day series and the Twenty20 match as well. But it sits on top of that wraps around it and creates something bigger to aim for.�The ECB is very keen to be at the fore front of efforts to modernise the international game and we feel this is a good way of ensuring the game remains relevant in both fans and players minds.�If the same points formula had been applied to England�s winter tours, the outcome would have been decided in the last match and the Test series winners would have been pipped at the line. Of course we would love the final game to be a Super Series decider that would be perfect,� said Strauss.�If you look at the last two series we played � against South Africa we would have lost the Super Series in the final Twenty20 and against Pakistan in the UAE we would have won the Super Series in the super over in the final Twenty20. Anyone out there who doesn�t see the need for international cricket to keep moving forwards really does have their head stuck in the sand.�I think we have to be on the front foot on this and say look we have a very vibrant Test support in this country and we�ve seen some fantastic Test matches over the last 12-18 months but there are some worrying signs there,� so let�s act before it�s too late�.",5/20/2016,Sri Lanka Pakistan will face England under a new for,sports

"Manchester United substitute Jesse Lingard's superb volley in extra time secured a 2-1 win over Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium on Saturday for their first major trophy in three years.However, their Dutch manager Louis van Gaal was left wondering whether it would be enough to preserve his job two seasons into a three-year contract amid British media reports that Jose Mourinho would be offered the job next week.The game was locked at 1-1 after 90 minutes, Jason Puncheon coming off the bench to put London side Palace ahead 12 minutes from time before Juan Mata equalised three minutes later.United central defender Chris Smalling was sent off in the extra period for a second yellow card but Lingard's moment of class gave them the Cup for the first time since 2004.""It's fantastic to win this title for the club, the fans and also for me,"" Van Gaal said. ""Now I have won a Cup in four countries. Not many managers can say that so I am very happy.""I don't want to talk about leaving the club.""�<strong>BRILLIANT RUN</strongUnderdogs Palace took the lead when Puncheon, who had only come on six minutes earlier, deftly controlled a long ball into the area and fired past United goalkeeper David de Gea.But within three minutes Wayne Rooney went on a brilliant run across the edge of the Palace area and crossed for Marouane Fellaini to set up the equaliser for Spaniard Mata.Despite playing the second period of extra time with 10 men after Smalling's dismissal, United poured forward and Lingard's goal secured a 12th FA Cup triumph, equalling Arsenal's record.""I saw it come across and it landed nicely for me, all I had to do was hit it sweet and luckily I did that. As a sub you always have to be ready. Thankfully I was,"" Lingard said.Van Gaal, who arrived for his news conference carrying the trophy, added: ""It was a super goal when we needed it.""It was unbelievable that we had injuries again but in spite of going down to 10 players we showed the spirit we have shown on the road to the final.""Palace manager Alan Pardew, who played when the London club lost the replayed 1990 final against United, was frustrated by two refereeing decisions from Mark Clattenburg, who will be in charge of next weekend's Champions League final.He felt Wilfried Zaha should have had a penalty when tackled by Rooney and that play should have been waved on as Connor Wickham recovered from Smalling's challenge and scored.""It was a great cup final and could have gone either way,"" Pardew told reporters.�<strong>UNITED DANGEROUS</strongPalace did not get quite enough from speedy winger Zaha, who United once bought for 15 million pounds ($21.76 million) before selling him back to their opponents, and Yannick Bolasie.The London side threatened mainly from set pieces, although the tall Fellaini was a valuable asset in defending them.United made the more dangerous chances throughout the game, hitting the post twice early in the second half through Fellaini and young French striker Anthony Martial.Rooney was an influential captain in his deeper midfield role and 18 year-old Marcus Rashford made several of their best opportunities, but had to go off injured in the 72nd minute.Van Gaal could not say how serious the injury was or whether it would prevent Rashford joining the England squad next week.It was the second time United had won the FA Cup after having a player sent off. Irish defender Kevin Moran was the first man dismissed in a final, when they beat Everton in 1985. Smalling was the fourth and the first Englishman.There was a bonus in Palace's defeat for West Ham United, who will join United in the Europa League next season after the east London side move into their new Olympic Stadium ground.",5/22/2016,Sublime Lingard volley seals Man United FA Cup wi,sports

"strong>Cristiano Ronaldo owes most of his fame and fortune to his exploits with Real Madrid, yet he also remains a hugely influential figure when representing his country.</strongPortugal's results have improved enormously since Ronaldo made his international debut against Kazakhstan as an 18-year-old in 2003.Their recent record at major tournaments is the envy of many bigger countries after they reached the Euro 2004 final, 2006 World Cup semi-finals and the Euro 2012 semi-finals, where they lost to eventual winners Spain in a shootout.Portugal have suffered when Ronaldo, who has captained them since he was 22, has been off-form such as at the last World Cup when he suffered a bout of tendinosis in his left knee in the run-up to the competition.The Madeira-born forward, who makes a point of breaking records, is Portugal's all-time leading scorer with 56 goals in 125 appearances and needs three more caps to beat Luis Figo's record.Nevertheless, the three-time world player of the year has not been above criticism, with most of his goals coming in qualifying matches against weaker opponents and many supporters wondering why he did not take a penalty in the 2012 shootout against Spain.It is, though, hard to imagine Portugal without him and Ronaldo himself says he wants to play for his country until at least the 2018 World Cup and maybe beyond.""I don't make plans in my sporting life,"" he said in February.

"strong>English football's biggest club seem to have secured the services of the sport's most colourful manager after Jose Mourinho, according to Sky TV reports, agreed personal terms with Manchester United on Tuesday.</strongAfter a trophy-laden career with Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid, Mourinho is set to replace Dutchman Louis van Gaal, who was sacked on Monday, with a remit to bring back the glory days the club once took for granted under Alex Ferguson.The 53-year-old, sacked by Chelsea in December seven months after winning his third Premier League title at the London club over two spells, had been constantly linked with the United job as Van Gaal struggled to make an impression at Old Trafford.The Dutchman was dismissed two days after steering United to their first FA Cup success in 12 years when they beat Crystal Palace 2-1 after extra-time in Saturday's Wembley final.Van Gaal's preferred possession-dominated playing style at a club more readily associated with fast, direct attacking, was widely criticised, and it appeared to take his players time to adapt.Mourinho is also known for pragmatism, however, relying on a strong defensive foundation and hard-working midfielders and strikers.He has a history of success wherever he has managed and a proven track record in the English game.Mourinho won the UEFA Cup and Champions League as well as the domestic double twice in his two seasons at Porto and led Chelsea to their first top-flight title in 50 years in his first campaign, retaining it the following season.He also won the League Cup and FA Cup before moving to Inter where he won Serie A as well as the Champions League and Italian Cup.Mourinho helped Real to their first La Liga crown in four years and on returning to Chelsea, he again won the Premier League before an unexpectedly poor -- and troubled -- start to the 2015-16 season led to his sacking.�<strong>DIVIDED OPINION</strongHis imminent appointment at Old Trafford, touted in the media for months, will divide opinion but while some have voiced concern over playing style and potentially explosive personality clashes, he is widely considered to be as close to a guarantee of silverware as a manager can be.The challenge will be not only to deliver success but to do it in style.Van Gaal's FA Cup triumph was not enough to allow him to see out the final year of his contract on the back of a season in which the club's fans routinely voiced their frustration with the safety-first football being served up.Mourinho is not known for throwing caution to the wind but fans will hope that under his leadership United will at least not again be ranked top in the Premier League for the number of backwards passes made as they were under Van Gaal.There will also be pressure for the new man to continue the good work of his predecessor in bringing young players such as Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard to the fore, something else Mourinho has singularly failed to do at most of his previous clubs.However, after three seasons without a league title and with no Champions League football for a second time in three years, the United hierarchy are evidently prepared to accept potential downsides if the 'Special One' gets the club back to what they consider to be their rightful place at the sport's top table.Former Old Trafford goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel believes the Portuguese ""could save"" the club while Hull City manager Steve Bruce, who used to play in front of the Dane in central defence, said the chance to bring in Mourinho was ""too good to miss"".Former Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti, who will coach Bayern Munich next season, said Mourinho would be a ""fantastic signing"", adding United had ""lost its identity this last year"".Former Old Trafford great Eric Cantona, however, said his old team should have gone for incoming Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola instead, saying he ""loved"" Mourinho but that his style of play is ""not Manchester United"".Retired Dutch international Ronald de Boer believes Mourinho is ""similar"" to Van Gaal in being a ""workaholic"" who ""prepares perfectly on how to win"".De Boer, who worked with Van Gaal at Ajax Amsterdam and with both men at Barcelona, said of Mourinho: ""Sometimes it is not pretty but he knows how to grind out wins.

"strong>Brazilian investigators have expanded their probe into possible corruption around the staging of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro this August to include all the venues and services financed with federal funds, a lead prosecutor told Reuters.</strongFederal investigations have previously focused on ""legacy"" modernization projects not directly tied to the Games but this newly disclosed probe includes Olympic Park and the Deodoro area where Olympic venues are located, federal prosecutor Leandro Mitidieri said.""It's not just the physical works we're looking at - it is contracts for services, security, everything that used federal funds,"" he told Reuters from his Rio de Janeiro office late on Tuesday.The Olympics were meant to showcase Brazil's rise as a global power. Instead, they will take place as suspended President Dilma Rousseff faces an impeachment trial, the economy suffers its worst recession since the 1930s, an outbreak of the Zika virus prompts health concerns and a massive corruption scandal infuriates Brazilians.Mitidieri said his team is also investigating what happened to federal funds earmarked for cleaning Guanabara Bay, where Olympic sailing events will take place, and lakes that surround the main Olympic venues in western Rio's Barra neighborhood.Those bodies of water have heavy sewage contamination and remain badly polluted despite promises to drastically improve them as a legacy achievement of the Olympics.Another team of federal prosecutors, along with federal police, is investigating whether the Rio de Janeiro state water utility company Cedae committed environmental crimes by not properly treating sewage in Rio's metropolitan area of 12 million people, Mitidieri said.Rio utility Cedae said it had not been notified about the investigation and could not make a comment without understanding more about the probe.Mitidieri would not say if his team had uncovered any proof of corruption - but he added that detailed announcements about the investigation's results would be made in coming weeks.Five construction firms are building most of the 39 billion reais ($10.8 billion) worth of venues and infrastructure needed for Rio's Olympics. The figure includes at least 1.76 billion reais in federal funds, according to documents from Brazil's federal accounting court.All five companies are caught up in an investigation into price fixing and kickbacks at state-run oil company Petrobras, a two-year probe that has seen scores of top executives and politicians jailed, charged or under investigation.The Petrobras (PETR4.SA) investigation is what led federal police and prosecutors to begin looking at possible corruption tied to the Olympics.Federal authorities have already said they are investigating the Porto Maravilha project, an 8 billion real facelift of Rio's dilapidated port area, and also the expansion of the city's metro line to the Olympic area in Barra.Court files made public in March showed police uncovered documents from executives of Latin America's largest construction firm, Odebrecht SA [ODBES.UL], that referenced 1 million reais in suspected bribes connected to those two big legacy projects.Odebrecht is at the center of the Petrobras scandal and is involved in over half of all Olympic projects by value, according to contracts reviewed by Reuters.A spokeswoman for Odebrecht said by email that the company had no comment to make.Mitidieri declined to provide details on which companies are the focus of the federal probe, though he did note that OAS SA [OAS.UL] and Queiroz Galvao had ""a lot of activity"" in the Deodoro region of the Olympics. OAS did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Queiroz Galvao wrote in an email that the company had not been notified about the investigation and had no further comment.Rio de Janeiro's city government oversees most Olympic construction projects, though a few are financed by the federal or state government. The city government says contracts were mostly funded with private resources and that all bids were overseen by regulators.Rio 2016, the local organizing committee, handles some non-permanent structures like seating, and has a budget of 7 billion reais.The federal government, Mitidieri noted, is by law responsible for any debts the local organizing committee may incur.The Rio 2016 local organizing committee referred questions to the mayor's office.The mayor's office said it would not comment without knowing what exact contracts were under investigation. It added in its emailed response that all contracts were carried out in a transparent manner and that city officials were prepared to provide any clarifications necessary.�",5/26/2016,Exclusive Brazil investigating possible corruption at Olympic venu,sports

"strong>LONDON: India�s Anil Kumble and several other former Test players on an International Cricket Council committee have urged the sport�s law-makers to bring in new restrictions on the size of bats amid concerns over a glut of run-scoring.</strongFollowing a two-day meeting at Lord�s, the headquarters of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the ICC cricket committee chaired by Kumble issued a statement saying it wanted MCC, which still has overall global responsibility for cricket�s Laws or rules, to instigate a clampdown.While there are limitations on bat length (when the lower portion of the handle is inserted it shall not be more than 38in/96.5cm) and width (4.25in/10.8cm at its widest part), none currently exist on depth.Modern manufacturers have become increasingly skilled at making bats with larger �sweet spots� that do not feel as heavy to pick-up as the blades that were once only the preserve of 1980s power-hitters such as West Indies great Clive Lloyd and England hero Ian Botham.The balance between bat and ball has become especially loaded against bowlers in limited overs games where the innovations brought in by Twenty20 cricket, allied to increasingly short boundaries, have led to an orgy of run-scoring.Last year�s 50-over World Cup in Australia and New Zealand witnessed 38 hundreds, nearly one every game, and 463 sixes, an average of one every nine overs.West Indies� Chris Gayle struck 16 sixes in racing to the fastest one-day international double hundred during a World Cup match against Zimbabwe at Canberra�s Manuka Oval, while New Zealand�s Martin Guptill hit a six measured at 110 metres in the course of his 237 against the West Indies at Wellington.Thursday�s statement from the ICC cricket committee, whose members include several former Test batsmen in England�s Andrew Strauss, India�s Rahul Dravid and Sri Lanka�s Mahela Jayawardene, said: ""MCC sought the committee�s guidance on the desirability of making changes in order to redress the balance between bat and ball.""The committee received a research paper from MCC citing a wealth of scientific and statistical evidence showing bats have become more powerful in recent years, primarily due to having larger �sweet-spots�.""It added: ""The committee�s view was that MCC should strongly consider limiting the dimensions of cricket bats to help achieve a better balance between bat and ball.""South Africa batting great Barry Richards, speaking during last year�s World Cup, said restrictions were urgently needed to bring modern-day bats into line with the kind of relatively slim models he used in his 1970s heyday.""The pressing of cricket bats has to be controlled and the thickness in their edges. Maybe there can also be a designated sweet-spot area for bats,"" Richards told the Sydney Daily Telegraph.""Ours used to be about the size of a 50 cent piece but now they are much bigger...
